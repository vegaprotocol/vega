Feature: Check that bond slashing works with non-default asset decimals, market decimals, position decimals.

  Background:

    Given the log normal risk model named "log-normal-risk-model-1":
      | risk aversion | tau | mu | r | sigma |
      | 0.000001      | 0.1 | 0  | 0 | 1.0   |
    And the following assets are registered:
      | id  | decimal places |
      | USD | 3              |
    And the fees configuration named "fees-config-1":
      | maker fee | infrastructure fee |
      | 0.004     | 0.001              |
    And the price monitoring named "price-monitoring-1":
      | horizon | probability | auction extension |
      | 1       | 0.99        | 300               |
    And the following network parameters are set:

      | market.liquidity.bondPenaltyParameter         | 0.1   |
      | market.liquidity.targetstake.triggering.ratio | 0.24  |
    And the markets:
