Feature: Price monitoring test using forward risk model (bounds for the valid price moves around price of 100000 for the two horizons are: [95878,104251], [90497,110401])

  Background:
    Given time is updated to "2020-10-16T00:00:00Z"
    And the price monitoring updated every "6000" seconds named "my-price-monitoring":
      | horizon | probability | auction extension |
      | 3600    | 0.95        | 240               |
      | 7200    | 0.999       | 360               |
    And the log normal risk model named "my-log-normal-risk-model":
      | risk aversion | tau                    | mu | r     | sigma |
      | 0.000001      | 0.00011407711613050422 | 0  | 0.016 | 2.0   |

      | name                           | value |
      | market.auction.minimumDuration | 3600  |
    And the oracles broadcast data signed with "0xDEADBEEF":
      | name             | value |
      | prices.ETH.value | 42    |
