Feature: Set up a market, with an opening auction, then uncross the book

  Background:
    And the simple risk model named "my-simple-risk-model":
      | long                   | short                  | max move up | min move down | probability of trading |
      | 0.08628781058136630000 | 0.09370922348428490000 | -1          | -1            | 0.1                    |
    And the fees configuration named "my-fees-config":
      | maker fee | infrastructure fee |
      | 0.004     | 0.001              |
    And the markets:
      | id        | quote name | asset | risk model           | margin calculator         | auction duration | fees           | price monitoring | oracle config          |

  Scenario: set up 2 traders with balance
    Given the traders deposit on asset's general account the following amount:
      | trader    | asset | amount       |
      | trader1   | ETH   | 1000000000   |
      | trader2   | ETH   | 1000000000   |
      | trader3   | ETH   | 1000000000   |
      | auxiliary | ETH   | 100000000000 |
      | trader-lp | ETH   | 100000000000 |
    And the traders submit the following liquidity provision:
      | id  | party     | market id | commitment amount | fee | side | pegged reference | proportion | offset |
      | lp1 | trader-lp | ETH/DEC20 | 30000000          | 0.3 | buy  | BID              | 50         | -10    |

    # place auxiliary orders so we always have best bid and best offer as to not trigger the liquidity auction
    And the traders place the following orders:
      | trader    | market id | side | volume | price     | resulting trades | type       | tif     |
      | auxiliary | ETH/DEC20 | buy  | 1      | 1         | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |
      | auxiliary | ETH/DEC20 | sell | 1      | 100000000 | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |

    # place orders and generate trades - slippage 100
    When the traders place the following orders:
      | trader  | market id | side | volume | price    | resulting trades | type       | tif     | reference |

    And the opening auction period ends for market "ETH/DEC20"
    Then the following trades should be executed:
      | buyer   | price    | size | seller  |
