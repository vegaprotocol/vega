Feature: Fees reward calculations for a single asset, single market

  Background:
    Given the following network parameters are set:
      | name                                              | value  |

      | reward.staking.delegation.optimalStakeMultiplier  | 5.0    |

    Given time is updated to "2021-08-26T00:00:00Z"
    Given the average block duration is "2"

     #complete the epoch to advance to a meaningful epoch (can't setup transfer to start at epoch 0)
    Then the network moves ahead "7" blocks

  Scenario: Testing fees in continuous trading with one trade and no liquidity providers - testing maker fee received
    Given the fees configuration named "fees-config-1":
      | maker fee | infrastructure fee |
      | 0.005     | 0.002              |
    And the price monitoring updated every "1000" seconds named "price-monitoring":
      | horizon | probability | auction extension |
      | 1       | 0.99        | 3                 |

    And the simple risk model named "simple-risk-model-1":
      | long | short | max move up | min move down | probability of trading |
      | 0.2  | 0.1   | 100         | -100          | 0.1                    |

    And the markets:

    Given the parties deposit on asset's general account the following amount:

    #complete the epoch for rewards to take place
    Then the network moves ahead "7" blocks
