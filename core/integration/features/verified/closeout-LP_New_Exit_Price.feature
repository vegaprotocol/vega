  # Replicate a scenario from Lewis
  Background:

    Given the log normal risk model named "log-normal-risk-model-1":

      | 0.000001      | 0.1 | 0  | 0 | 1.0   |
    #risk factor short = 3.5569036
    #risk factor long = 0.800728208

      | horizon  | probability | auction extension |
      | 72000000 | 0.99        | 3                 |

    # 1. trader B made LP commitment 150,000
    # 2. trader C and A cross at 0.5 with size of 111, and this opens continuous trading (trade B is short)
    # 3. trader C comes with an order with crazy price
    # 4. trader Bâ€™s margin has increased sharply because of the order (from step2),
    # 5. trader A and C and trigger MTM
    # 6. trader B got closeout out, and the closeout trade was between trader B - network - trader C
