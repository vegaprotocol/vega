Feature: Test LP mechanics when there are multiple liquidity providers;

  Background:

    Given the margin calculator named "margin-calculator-1":
      | search factor | initial factor | release factor |
      | 1.2           | 1.5            | 1.7            |
    Given the log normal risk model named "log-normal-risk-model":
      | risk aversion | tau | mu | r | sigma |
      | 0.000001      | 0.1 | 0  | 0 | 1.0   |
    #risk factor short:3.5569036
    #risk factor long:0.801225765
    And the following assets are registered:
      | id  | decimal places |
      | USD | 0              |
    And the fees configuration named "fees-config-1":
      | maker fee | infrastructure fee |
      | 0.0004    | 0.001              |
    And the price monitoring named "price-monitoring":
      | horizon | probability | auction extension |
      | 3600    | 0.99        | 3                 |

    And the liquidity sla params named "SLA":
      | price range | commitment min time fraction | performance hysteresis epochs | sla competition factor |
      | 0.00001     |                          0.5 |                             1 |                    1.0 |

    And the markets:
      | id        | quote name | asset | risk model            | margin calculator   | auction duration | fees          | price monitoring | data source config     | linear slippage factor | quadratic slippage factor | sla params |
      | ETH/MAR22 | USD | USD | log-normal-risk-model | margin-calculator-1 | 2 | fees-config-1 | price-monitoring | default-eth-for-future | 1e0 | 0 | SLA |

    And the following network parameters are set:
      | name                                                  | value |
      | market.value.windowLength                             | 60s   |

      | market.liquidity.targetstake.triggering.ratio         | 0.5   |
      | network.markPriceUpdateMaximumFrequency               | 0s    |

      | market.auction.minimumDuration                        | 1     |
      | market.fee.factors.infrastructureFee                  | 0.001 |
      | market.fee.factors.makerFee                           | 0.004 |
      | market.liquidity.bondPenaltyParameter               | 0.2   |
      | validators.epoch.length                               | 5s    |

      | market.liquidity.providersFeeCalculationTimeStep    | 10s   |

    Given the average block duration is "2"
  @Now
  Scenario: 001: lp1 and lp2 under supplies liquidity (and expects to get penalty for not meeting the SLA) since both have orders outside price range
    Given the parties deposit on asset's general account the following amount:
      | party  | asset | amount |
      | lp1    | USD   | 200000  |
      | lp2 | USD | 15000 |
      | party1 | USD   | 100000 |
      | party2 | USD   | 100000 |
      | party3 | USD   | 100000 |

    And the parties submit the following liquidity provision:
      | id   | party | market id | commitment amount | fee   | lp type    |
      | lp_1 | lp1   | ETH/MAR22 | 80000              | 0.02  | submission |
      | lp_2 | lp2   | ETH/MAR22 | 500               | 0.01  | submission |

    When the network moves ahead "2" blocks
    And the parties place the following pegged iceberg orders:
      | party | market id | peak size | minimum visible size | side | pegged reference | volume | offset | reference |
      | lp1   | ETH/MAR22 | 2         | 1                    | buy  | BID              | 2      | 200    | lp-b-1    |
      | lp1   | ETH/MAR22 | 2         | 1                    | sell | ASK              | 2      | 200    | lp-s-1    |
      | lp2   | ETH/MAR22 | 2         | 1                    | buy  | BID              | 2      | 200    | lp-b-2    |
      | lp2   | ETH/MAR22 | 2         | 1                    | sell | ASK              | 2      | 200    | lp-s-2    |

    Then the parties place the following orders:
      | party  | market id | side | volume | price | resulting trades | type       | tif     |
      | party1 | ETH/MAR22 | buy  | 10     | 900   | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |
      | party1 | ETH/MAR22 | buy  | 1      | 1000  | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |
      | party2 | ETH/MAR22 | sell | 10     | 1100  | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |
      | party2 | ETH/MAR22 | sell | 1      | 1000  | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |

    Then the opening auction period ends for market "ETH/MAR22"
    And the following trades should be executed:
      | buyer  | price | size | seller |
      | party1 | 1000  | 1    | party2 |

    And the market data for the market "ETH/MAR22" should be:
      | mark price | trading mode            | horizon | min bound | max bound | target stake | supplied stake | open interest |
      | 1000 | TRADING_MODE_CONTINUOUS       | 3600    | 973       | 1027      | 35569        | 80500          | 1             |
# # target_stake = mark_price x max_oi x target_stake_scaling_factor x rf = 1000 x 10 x 1 x 3.5569036

    And the liquidity fee factor should be "0.02" for the market "ETH/MAR22"

    And the parties should have the following account balances:
      | party | asset | market id | margin | general | bond  |
      | lp1 | USD | ETH/MAR22 | 10671 | 109329 | 80000 |
      | lp2   | USD   | ETH/MAR22 | 10671  | 3829    | 500   |
    #margin_intial lp2: 2*1000*3.5569036*1.5=10671
#lp1: 21342+98658+80000=200000; lp2: 10671+3829+500=15000

    Then the parties place the following orders:
      | party  | market id | side | volume | price | resulting trades | type       | tif     |
      | party1 | ETH/MAR22 | buy  | 1      | 1000  | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |
      | party2 | ETH/MAR22 | sell | 1      | 1000  | 1                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |

    And the market data for the market "ETH/MAR22" should be:
      | mark price | trading mode            | horizon | min bound | max bound | target stake | supplied stake | open interest |
      | 1000       | TRADING_MODE_CONTINUOUS | 3600    | 973       | 1027      | 71138         | 80500           | 2             |

    Then the network moves ahead "6" blocks

    And the parties should have the following account balances:
      | party | asset | market id | margin | general | bond  |
      | lp1 | USD | ETH/MAR22 | 10671 | 109329 | 40000 |
      | lp2   | USD   | ETH/MAR22 | 10671  | 3829    | 250   |
#liquidity fee: 1000*0.02 = 20; lp1 get 19, lp2 get 0

    Then the following transfers should happen:
      | from   | to     | from account                   | to account                     | market id | amount | asset |
      | market | lp1    | ACCOUNT_TYPE_FEES_LIQUIDITY    | ACCOUNT_TYPE_LP_LIQUIDITY_FEES | ETH/MAR22 | 19     | USD   |
      | market | lp2    | ACCOUNT_TYPE_FEES_LIQUIDITY    | ACCOUNT_TYPE_LP_LIQUIDITY_FEES | ETH/MAR22 | 0      | USD   |
      | lp1    | market | ACCOUNT_TYPE_BOND              | ACCOUNT_TYPE_INSURANCE         | ETH/MAR22 | 40000  | USD   |
      | lp2    | market | ACCOUNT_TYPE_BOND              | ACCOUNT_TYPE_INSURANCE         | ETH/MAR22 | 250    | USD   |
      | lp1    | market | ACCOUNT_TYPE_LP_LIQUIDITY_FEES | ACCOUNT_TYPE_INSURANCE         | ETH/MAR22 | 19     | USD   |
      | lp2    | market | ACCOUNT_TYPE_LP_LIQUIDITY_FEES | ACCOUNT_TYPE_INSURANCE         | ETH/MAR22 | 0      | USD   |

    And the insurance pool balance should be "40269" for the market "ETH/MAR22"

    Then the network moves ahead "6" blocks

    And the parties should have the following account balances:
      | party | asset | market id | margin | general | bond  |
      | lp1   | USD   | ETH/MAR22 | 10671  | 109329  | 20000 |
      | lp2   | USD   | ETH/MAR22 | 10671  | 3829    | 125   |

    And the insurance pool balance should be "60394" for the market "ETH/MAR22"
# #increament in insurancepool: 60394-40269=20125 which is coming from SLA penalty on lp1 and lp2
