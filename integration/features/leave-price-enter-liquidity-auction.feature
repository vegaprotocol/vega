      | trader3  | ETH   | 1000000000 |
      | traderlp | ETH   | 1000000000 |

# submit our LP
    Then the traders submit the following liquidity provision:
      | id  | party    | market id | commitment amount | fee | side | pegged reference | proportion | offset |
      | lp1 | traderlp | ETH/DEC19 | 16000000          | 0.3 | buy  | BID              | 2          | -10    |
