# Getting Started

This document is a guide for new Go developers.

It starts with a vanilla Linux or MacOSX installation, and runs through all the
steps needed to build and test vega.

## Installing Golang

Almost all of vega (including tools not in this repo) are written in Go, so you will need it installed locally. The version targeted can be found in the `go.mod` at the root of this repo, but realistically there is not much harm in having a slightly newer version.

The Go tool-chain can be installed via an OS package manager, or directly from from https://golang.org/dl/. Use whichever you are most comfortable with. See also the [Golang installation guide](https://golang.org/doc/install) for more information.

After installation set the following environment variables:

```bash
# Add to $HOME/.bashrc:
export GOROOT="/path/to/your/go/install"
export GOPATH="$HOME/go"
export PATH="$PATH:$GOROOT/bin"
```

Now run the following to ensure everything exists and is in working order:

```bash
$ which go gofmt
/path/to/your/go/install/bin/go
/path/to/your/go/install/bin/gofmt

$ go version
go version go[INSTALLED VERSION] linux/amd64
```
## GitHub Authentication and Git configurations

To be able to clone/push/pull from github in a seamless way, it is worth setting up SSH keys in github so that authentication can happen magically. If not already set up, following this guide (https://github.com/settings/keys)

You also now need to tell git to prefer SSH over HTTPS when accessing all `vegaprotocol` repositories by doing the following:

```bash
git config --global url."git@github.com:vegaprotocol".insteadOf "https://github.com/vegaprotocol"
```

This is necessary since some of the repos that `vega` depends on in `vegaprotocol` are private repositories. The git setting ensure that `go get` now knows to use `ssh` too.


## MacOS Requirements

In order to get the required tools for MacOS make sure to install the following packages:
### `bash`
```bash
$ brew install bash
# now make sure you are using bash, not zsh (this can be tricky to modify)
```

### `jq`
```bash
$ brew install jq
```

### `gnu-sed`
```bash
$ brew install gnu-sed
# read the stdout, cos it asks you to modify `.profile` or `.bash_profile`
# e.g. add export PATH="/usr/local/Cellar/gnu-sed/4.8/libexec/gnubin:$PATH"
```

### `coreutils`
```bash
$ brew install coreutils
# again read the stdout - similar changes required to modify `.profile` or `.bash_profile`
# e.g export PATH="/usr/local/Cellar/coreutils/9.0/libexec/gnubin:$PATH" 
```

### `findutils`
```bash
$ brew install findutils
# again read the stdout to modify `.profile` or `.bash_profile`
# e.g. export PATH="/usr/local/Cellar/findutils/4.8.0_1/libexec/gnubin:$PATH"
```

## Building and Testing Vega

Go makes building easy:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:vegaprotocol/vega.git
cd vega

go install ./...

# check binary works
vega --help
```

And equally also makes testing easy:

```bash
go test ./...
go test -race ./...
go test -v ./integration/... --godog.format=pretty
```

There is also a `Makefile` which contain the above commands and also some other useful things.
## Running A Vega Node Locally

With vega built it is technically possible to run the node locally, but it is a bit cumbersome. The steps are here if you are feeling brave: https://github.com/vegaprotocol/networks

An alternative is to use `dockerisedvega` (DV) which will trivially spin up a working system for you. The script and some detailed information can be found here: https://github.com/vegaprotocol/devops-infra/blob/master/scripts/dockerisedvega.sh

### Accessing Docker Registry

To use the `dockerisedvega.sh` script, you will need to pull images from the Vega private docker registry on GitHub. To do this, you need to generate a personal access token and use it to log into the registry via the `docker-cli`.

To generate a personal access token, log into GitHub and navigate to the `Personal access tokens` page in your profile settings [https://github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens).

- Click on `Generate new token` button to generate a new token
- Under note, give the token a descriptive name so you know what the token is for
- Change the expiration to the desired duration.
- Under `Select scopes` choose the following options:
  - `repo` Full control of private repositories
  - `read:packages` Download packages from GitHub Package Registry
- Click on the `Generate token` button to generate a token

Once the token has been generated, you can use it to log into the GitHub Docker Registry. **Make sure you make a note of the Personal Access Token as it will only be shown the once after it has been generated**

- Open a terminal
- Enter the command `docker login ghcr.io --username <your-github-username>`
- When prompted for the password, enter the personal access token code that was generated

You should see a `Login successful` message once you have logged into the docker registry. Now you can use the `dockerisedvega.sh` script.

If you have installed docker on Linux for the first time, you might need to update the user groups on your machine to prevent the need for using `sudo` in front of each command.

```
 sudo groupadd docker
 sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
 ```
Then you will need to logout and back in again for the permissions to be updated

You can now run the following commands to get DV running locally. (Note that if you are on MacOS and probably also Windows you may need to increase the allocated memory to 4GB using the Docker Desktop UI):

```
dockerisedvega.sh --vega-loglevel DEBUG --prefix mydvbits --portbase 1000 --validators 2 --nonvalidators 1 start

dockerisedvega.sh --vega-loglevel DEBUG --prefix mydvbits --portbase 1000 --validators 2 --nonvalidators 1 stop
```

This will pull images containing the latest versions of all the vega tools. To inject a locally built vega into DV you need to build a new image. This can be done using the following script:

```
#!/bin/bash

# If on a Mac we will need to cross-compile
export GOOS=linux
export GOARCH=amd64

go build -v -gcflags "all=-N -l" -o "cmd/vega/vega-dbg-lin64" "./cmd/vega"

mkdir -p docker/bin
cp -a cmd/vega/vega-dbg-lin64 docker/bin/vega

# remove any existing image with that tag
docker rmi ghcr.io/vegaprotocol/vega/vega:local -f

docker build -t "ghcr.io/vegaprotocol/vega/vega:local
```

with this you can then run the DV start line again with the addition of the option `--vega-version local`.

## Other Things to Try and Build

There are other repos that you will probably need to touch at some point so it is worth trying to build those too. Having completed the above you will be in a good place to do this. Have a fiddle in these repos:
- `vegawallet`
- `data-node`
- `vegatools`
- `protos` (will involve some more go getting)
