    # Setting up the accounts and vAMM submission now is part of the background, because we'll be running scenarios 0090-VAMM-006 through 0090-VAMM-014 on this setup
    Given the parties deposit on asset's general account the following amount:
      | party  | asset | amount  |
      | lp1    | USD   | 1000000 |
      | lp2    | USD   | 1000000 |

      | vamm1  | USD   | 1000000 |
      | vamm2  | USD   | 1000000 |

    When the parties submit the following liquidity provision:
      | id   | party | market id | commitment amount | fee   | lp type    |
      | lp_1 | lp1   | ETH/MAR22 | 10000             | 0.02  | submission |

    And the parties place the following orders:
      | party  | market id | side | volume | price | resulting trades | type       | tif     | reference |
      | lp1    | ETH/MAR22 | buy  | 20     | 40    | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | lp1-b     |

    When the opening auction period ends for market "ETH/MAR22"
    Then the following trades should be executed:
      | buyer  | price | size | seller |
      | party1 | 100   | 1    | party2 |
      
    Then the network moves ahead "1" epochs
    And the current epoch is "1"

    Then the parties submit the following AMM:
      | party | market id | amount | slippage | base | lower bound | upper bound  | proposed fee |
      | vamm1 | ETH/MAR22 | 100000  | 0.05     | 100  | 90          | 110         | 0.03         |
    Then the AMM pool status should be:
      | party | market id | amount | status        | base | lower bound | upper bound | 
      | vamm1 | ETH/MAR22 | 100000  | STATUS_ACTIVE | 100  | 90          | 110         | 

  @VAMM
  Scenario: a vAMM submits a rebasing order to SELL when its base is lower than an existing AMM's

    When the parties submit the following AMM:

      | vamm1 | ETH/MAR22 | vamm1-id |
      | vamm2 | ETH/MAR22 | vamm2-id |

    # second AMM has its base 5 away from the first AMM so it must submit a rebasing-order 
    And the following trades should be executed:
      | buyer    | price | size | seller   | is amm |
      | vamm1-id | 101   | 140  | vamm2-id | true   |
    Then the network moves ahead "1" blocks

    # and now the mid-price has shifted lower to a value between the two AMM's bases 95 < 97 < 100
    And the market data for the market "ETH/MAR22" should be:
