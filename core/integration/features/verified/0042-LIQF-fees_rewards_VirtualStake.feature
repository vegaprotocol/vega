Feature: Test liquidity provider reward distribution; Should also cover liquidity-fee-setting and equity-like-share calc and total stake.
# to look into and test: If an equity-like share is small and LP rewards are distributed immediately, then how do we round? (does a small share get rounded up or down, do they all add up?)
#Check what happens with time and distribution period (both in genesis and mid-market)

  Background:

      | maker fee | infrastructure fee |
      | 0.0004    | 0.001              |
    And the price monitoring named "price-monitoring":
      | horizon | probability | auction extension |
      | 1       | 0.99        | 3                 |
