Feature: Test settlement at expiry time from internal oracle

  Background:
    Given time is updated to "2019-11-30T00:00:00Z"
    And the average block duration is "1"

    And the oracle spec for settlement price filtering data from "0xCAFECAFE" named "ethDec20Oracle":
      | property         | type         | binding          |
      | prices.ETH.value | TYPE_INTEGER | settlement price |

    And the oracle spec for trading termination filtering data from "vegaprotocol.builtin" named "ethDec20Oracle":
      | property                       | type           | binding             | condition                      | value                |
      | vegaprotocol.builtin.timestamp | TYPE_TIMESTAMP | trading termination | OPERATOR_GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL | 2019-12-31T23:59:59Z |

    And the oracle spec for settlement price filtering data from "0xCAFECAFE1" named "ethDec21Oracle":
      | property         | type         | binding          |
      | prices.ETH.value | TYPE_INTEGER | settlement price |

    And the oracle spec for trading termination filtering data from "0xCAFECAFE1" named "ethDec21Oracle":
      | property           | type         | binding             |
      | trading.terminated | TYPE_BOOLEAN | trading termination |

    And the settlement price decimals for the oracle named "ethDec20Oracle" is given in "0" decimal places
    And the settlement price decimals for the oracle named "ethDec21Oracle" is given in "0" decimal places
    
    And the following network parameters are set:
      | name                           | value |
      | market.auction.minimumDuration | 1     |

    And the fees configuration named "fees-config-1":
      | maker fee | infrastructure fee |
      | 0.005     | 0.02               |
    And the price monitoring named "price-monitoring-1":
      | horizon | probability | auction extension |
      | 1       | 0.99        | 300               |
    And the simple risk model named "simple-risk-model-1":

      | 0.2  | 0.1   | 100         | -100          | 0.1                    |

    And the markets:
      | id        | quote name | asset | risk model                  | margin calculator         | auction duration | fees          | price monitoring   | oracle config  |

  Scenario: Order cannot be placed once the market is expired
    Given the parties deposit on asset's general account the following amount:
      | party  | asset | amount |
      | party1 | ETH   | 10000  |
      | aux1   | ETH   | 100000 |
      | aux2   | ETH   | 100000 |
      | lpprov | ETH   | 100000 |
