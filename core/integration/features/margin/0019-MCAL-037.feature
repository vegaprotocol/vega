Feature: Test magin under isolated margin mode when there is not enough collateral
  Background:
    # Set liquidity parameters to allow "zero" target-stake which is needed to construct the order-book defined in the ACs
    Given the following network parameters are set:
      | name                                    | value |
      | network.markPriceUpdateMaximumFrequency | 0s    |
    And the liquidity monitoring parameters:
      | name       | triggering ratio | time window | scaling factor |
      | lqm-params | 0.00             | 24h         | 1e-9           |
    And the simple risk model named "simple-risk-model":
      | long | short | max move up | min move down | probability of trading |
      | 0.1  | 0.1   | 100         | -100          | 0.2                    |
    And the markets:

  Scenario: Check margin update when party does not have sufficient collateral
    Given the parties deposit on asset's general account the following amount:
      | party            | asset | amount       |
      | buySideProvider  | USD   | 100000000000 |
      | sellSideProvider | USD   | 100000000000 |
      | party            | USD   | 48050        |
    And the parties place the following orders:
      | party            | market id | side | volume | price  | resulting trades | type       | tif     | reference  |
      | buySideProvider  | ETH/FEB23 | buy  | 10     | 14900  | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |            |

    # Checks for 0019-MCAL-031
    When the network moves ahead "2" blocks
    # Check mark-price matches the specification
    Then the mark price should be "15900" for the market "ETH/FEB23"
    # Check order book matches the specification
    And the order book should have the following volumes for market "ETH/FEB23":
      | side | price  | volume |
      | buy  | 14900  | 10     |
      | buy  | 15000  | 1      |
      | sell | 100000 | 1      |
      | sell | 100100 | 10     |
    # Check party margin levels match the specification
    And the parties should have the following margin levels:
      | party | market id | maintenance | search | initial | release |
      | party | ETH/FEB23 | 9540        | 10494  | 11448   | 13356   |
    #margin = min(3*(100000-15900), 15900*(0.25))+0.1*15900=5565

    Then the parties should have the following account balances:
      | party | asset | market id | margin | general |
      | party | USD   | ETH/FEB23 | 11448  | 36602   |

    #AC: 0019-MCAL-032, switch to isolated margin is rejected becuase selected margin factor is too small
    And the parties submit update margin mode:

      | party | ETH/FEB23 | isolated margin | 0.11          | required position margin must be greater than initial margin |

    And the parties should have the following margin levels:
      | party | market id | maintenance | search | initial | release | margin mode  | margin factor | order |
      | party | ETH/FEB23 | 9540        | 10494  | 11448   | 13356   | cross margin | 0.9           | 0     |

    Then the parties should have the following account balances:
      | party | asset | market id | margin | general |
      | party | USD   | ETH/FEB23 | 11448  | 36602   |

    And the network moves ahead "1" blocks

      | party | ETH/FEB23 | isolated margin | 0.9           | insufficient balance in general account to cover for required order margin |
    And the network moves ahead "2" blocks

    And the parties should have the following margin levels:

    #AC: 0019-MCAL-066 switch to isolated margin is accepted when party has sufficent balance
    And the parties submit update margin mode:
      | party | market    | margin_mode     | margin_factor |
      | party | ETH/FEB23 | isolated margin | 0.5           |
    And the network moves ahead "2" blocks

    And the parties should have the following margin levels:
