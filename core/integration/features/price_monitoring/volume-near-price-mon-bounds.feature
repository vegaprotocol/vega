# Test volume and margin when LP volume is pushed inside price monitoring bounds
# and the price monitoring bounds happen to be best bid/ask
Feature: Test margin for lp near price monitoring boundaries

  Background:
    Given the following network parameters are set:
      | name                                                | value |
      | market.value.windowLength                           | 1h    |
      | market.stake.target.timeWindow                      | 24h   |
      | market.stake.target.scalingFactor                   | 1     |
      | market.liquidity.targetstake.triggering.ratio       | 0     |
      | market.liquidity.providers.fee.distributionTimeStep | 10m   |
      | network.markPriceUpdateMaximumFrequency             | 0s    |

    And the average block duration is "1"

  Scenario: first scenario for volume at near price monitoring bounds and simple-risk-model

    Given the simple risk model named "simple-risk-model-1":
      | long | short | max move up | min move down | probability of trading |
      | 0.1  | 0.1   | 100         | -100          | 0.2                    |
    And the fees configuration named "fees-config-1":
      | maker fee | infrastructure fee |
      | 0.004     | 0.001              |
    And the price monitoring named "price-monitoring-1":
      | horizon | probability | auction extension |
      | 1       | 0.99        | 300               |
    And the markets:
      | id        | quote name | asset | risk model          | margin calculator         | auction duration | fees          | price monitoring   | data source config     |
      | ETH/DEC21 | ETH        | ETH   | simple-risk-model-1 | default-margin-calculator | 1                | fees-config-1 | price-monitoring-1 | default-eth-for-future |
    And the parties deposit on asset's general account the following amount:
      | party  | asset | amount    |
      | lp1    | ETH   | 100000000 |
      | party1 | ETH   | 10000000  |
      | party2 | ETH   | 10000000  |

    Given the parties submit the following liquidity provision:
      | id          | party | market id | commitment amount | fee   | side | pegged reference | proportion | offset | lp type    |
      | commitment1 | lp1   | ETH/DEC21 | 78000000          | 0.001 | buy  | BID              | 500        | 100    | submission |
      | commitment1 | lp1   | ETH/DEC21 | 78000000          | 0.001 | sell | ASK              | 500        | 100    | amendment  |
    And the parties place the following orders:
      | party  | market id | side | volume | price | resulting trades | type       | tif     | reference  |
      | party1 | ETH/DEC21 | buy  | 1      | 900   | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | buy-ref-1  |
      | party1 | ETH/DEC21 | buy  | 10     | 1000  | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | buy-ref-2  |
      | party2 | ETH/DEC21 | sell | 1      | 1100  | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | sell-ref-1 |
      | party2 | ETH/DEC21 | sell | 10     | 1000  | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | sell-ref-2 |

    When the opening auction period ends for market "ETH/DEC21"
    Then the auction ends with a traded volume of "10" at a price of "1000"

    And the parties should have the following profit and loss:
      | party  | volume | unrealised pnl | realised pnl |
      | party1 | 10     | 0              | 0            |
      | party2 | -10    | 0              | 0            |

    And the market data for the market "ETH/DEC21" should be:
      | mark price | trading mode            | horizon | min bound | max bound | target stake | supplied stake | open interest |
      | 1000       | TRADING_MODE_CONTINUOUS | 1       | 900       | 1100      | 1000         | 78000000       | 10            |

    # at this point what's left on the book is the buy @ 900 and sell @ 1100
    # so the best bid/ask coincides with the price monitoring bounds.
    # Since the lp1 offset is +/- 100 (depending on side) the lp1 volume "should" go to 800 and 1200
    # but because the price monitoring bounds are 900 and 1100 the volume gets pushed to these
    # i.e. it's placed at 900 / 1100.
    # As these are the best bid / best ask the probability of trading used is 1/2.

    And the parties should have the following margin levels:
      | party | market id | maintenance | search   | initial  | release  |
      | lp1   | ETH/DEC21 | 9750000     | 10725000 | 11700000 | 13650000 |

    And the parties should have the following account balances:
      | party | asset | market id | margin   | general  | bond     |
      | lp1   | ETH   | ETH/DEC21 | 11700000 | 10300000 | 78000000 |


    Then the parties place the following orders:
      | party  | market id | side | volume | price | resulting trades | type       | tif     | reference |
      | party1 | ETH/DEC21 | buy  | 1      | 900   | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | buy-ref-3 |

    And the parties should have the following margin levels:
      | party | market id | maintenance | search   | initial  | release  |
      | lp1   | ETH/DEC21 | 9750000     | 10725000 | 11700000 | 13650000 |

    # now we place an order which makes the best bid 901.
    Then the parties place the following orders:
      | party  | market id | side | volume | price | resulting trades | type       | tif     | reference |
      | party1 | ETH/DEC21 | buy  | 1      | 901   | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | buy-ref-4 |

    # the lp1 one volume on this side should go to 801 but because price monitoring bound is still 900 it gets pushed to 900.
    # but 900 is no longer the best bid, so the risk model is used to get prob of trading. This is 0.1 (see above).
    # Hence a lot more volume is required to meet commitment and thus the margin requirement jumps substantially.

    And the parties should have the following margin levels:
      | party | market id | maintenance | search   | initial  | release  |
      | lp1   | ETH/DEC21 | 9737900     | 10711690 | 11685480 | 13633060 |
