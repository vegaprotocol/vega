    Then the opening auction period ends for market "BTC/ETH"
    And the trading mode should be "TRADING_MODE_CONTINUOUS" for the market "BTC/ETH"

    Given time is updated to "2019-11-30T00:00:10Z"

    # check the stop order is filled
    Then the stop orders should have the following states
      | party  | market id | status           | reference |
      | party1 | BTC/ETH   | STATUS_TRIGGERED | stop1     |

    # add 20 secs, should expire
    Given time is updated to "2019-11-30T00:00:30Z"
    # check the stop order was not triggered a second at time T
    # bought 20, sold 10 with the stop order
    Then "party1" should have general account balance of "1000010" for asset "BTC"

  Scenario: Attempting to create more stop orders than is allowed by the relevant network parameter will result in the transaction failing to execute. (0014-ORDT-126)
