Feature: check if the realised PnL and unreaslied PnL is calculated according to spec in glossaries: https://github.com/vegaprotocol/specs/blob/master/glossaries/trading-and-protocol-glossary.md

  Background:

    #risk factor short: 3.5569036
    #risk factor long: 0.801225765
    And the fees configuration named "fees-config-1":
      | maker fee | infrastructure fee |

    And the average block duration is "1"

    And the parties submit the following liquidity provision:
      | id  | party  | market id | commitment amount | fee   | side | pegged reference | proportion | offset | lp type    |
      | lp1 | party0 | ETH/MAR22 | 5000000           | 0.001 | sell | ASK              | 500        | 20     | submission |
