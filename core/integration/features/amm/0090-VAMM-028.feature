    # Setting up the accounts and vAMM submission now is part of the background, because we'll be running scenarios 0087-VAMM-006 through 0087-VAMM-014 on this setup
    Given the parties deposit on asset's general account the following amount:
      | party  | asset | amount  |

    Then the network moves ahead "4" blocks
    And the current epoch is "0"

    And the parties place the following orders:
