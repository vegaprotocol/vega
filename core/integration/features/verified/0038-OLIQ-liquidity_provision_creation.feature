  Background:

    And the markets:
      | id        | quote name | asset | risk model                  | margin calculator         | auction duration | fees         | price monitoring | data source config          |

    And the following network parameters are set:
      | name                           | value |
      | market.auction.minimumDuration | 1     |

    Given the parties deposit on asset's general account the following amount:
      | party           | asset | amount    |
      | party1          | ETH   | 100000000 |
      | sellSideProvider | ETH   | 100000000 |
      | buySideProvider  | ETH   | 100000000 |
      | auxiliary        | ETH   | 100000000 |
      | aux2             | ETH   | 100000000 |

    When the parties submit the following liquidity provision:
      | id  | party  | market id | commitment amount | fee | side | pegged reference | proportion | offset | lp type    |
      | lp1 | party1 | ETH/DEC19 | 50000             | 0.1 | buy  | BID              | 500        | 10     | submission |

    Then the order book should have the following volumes for market "ETH/DEC19":
      | side | price   | volume |
      | sell | 120     | 1      |
      | buy  | 80      | 1      |
      | buy  | 100     | 1      |
      | sell | 100     | 1      |
    
    Then the opening auction period ends for market "ETH/DEC19"

    And the trading mode should be "TRADING_MODE_CONTINUOUS" for the market "ETH/DEC19"

    Then the following trades should be executed:
      | buyer   | price    | size | seller    |
      | aux2    | 100      | 1    | auxiliary |
    And the mark price should be "100" for the market "ETH/DEC19"

    Then the orders should have the following states:

      | lp1 | party1 | ETH/DEC19 | 50000             | STATUS_ACTIVE |
    Then the orders should have the following states:
