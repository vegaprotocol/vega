# Contributing

Create a Gitlab Issue for the feature, bugfix or enhancement. Start a
discussion, pull in relevant people, build a technical design.

If possible, Issues should be linked back to a feature in the Product repo.

Make a branch off `develop`, perhaps create a WIP MR to go with it. Work on the
Issue, push code to `origin` every now and again, continue discussion either on
the Issue or in the WIP MR.

Pairing and early review is encouraged.

Add tests! Aim for overall test coverage to go _up_. At a bare minimum, the main
code path of each function should be tested.

When ready, create a merge requst (or remove the WIP from the existing one), ask
for review on Slack, discuss suggestions, get the branch merged.
