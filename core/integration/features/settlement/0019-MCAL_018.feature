    When time is updated to "2021-02-11T16:35:24Z"
    Then system unix time is "1613061324"

    When the oracles broadcast data with block time signed with "0xCAFECAFE2":
      | name             | value      | time offset |
      | perp.funding.cue | 1613061324 | 0s          |
      
    When time is updated to "2021-08-12T11:04:07Z"
    Then system unix time is "1628766247"

    When the network moves ahead "5" blocks
    When the oracles broadcast data with block time signed with "0xCAFECAFE2":
      | name             | value      | time offset |
      | perp.ETH.value   | 300000     | 0s          |
      | perp.funding.cue | 1628766252 | 0s          |
    #1628766252 is half year after the first oracel time

    And the following transfers should happen:
      | from   | to     | from account            | to account              | market id | amount | asset |
      | aux2   | market | ACCOUNT_TYPE_MARGIN     | ACCOUNT_TYPE_SETTLEMENT | ETH/DEC19 | 74700  | USD   |
