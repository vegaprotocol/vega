Feature: Regression test for issue 598

  Background:
    Given the insurance pool initial balance for the markets is "0":
    And the execution engine have these markets:
      | name      | quote name | asset | risk model | lamd/long | tau/short              | mu/max move up | r/min move down | sigma | release factor | initial factor | search factor | auction duration | maker fee | infrastructure fee | liquidity fee | p. m. update freq. | p. m. horizons | p. m. probs | p. m. durations | prob. of trading | oracle spec pub. keys | oracle spec property | oracle spec property type | oracle spec binding |
      | ETH/DEC19 | BTC        | BTC   | forward    | 0.001     | 0.00011407711613050422 | 0              | 0.016           | 2.0   | 1.4            | 1.2            | 1.1           | 1                | 0         | 0                  | 0             | 0                  |                |             |                 | 0.1              | 0xDEADBEEF,0xCAFEDOOD | prices.ETH.value     | TYPE_INTEGER              | prices.ETH.value    |
    And oracles broadcast data signed with "0xDEADBEEF":
      | name             | value |
      | prices.ETH.value | 42    |

  Scenario: Open position but ZERO in margin account
    Given the traders make the following deposits on asset's general account:
      | trader  | asset | amount  |
      | edd     | BTC   | 1000    |
      | barney  | BTC   | 1000    |
      | chris   | BTC   | 1000    |
      | trader1 | BTC   | 1000000 |
      | trader2 | BTC   | 1000000 |
      | aux     | BTC   | 1000    |

    # place auxiliary orders so we always have best bid and best offer as to not trigger the liquidity auction
    Then traders place following orders:
      | trader  | market id | side | volume | price | resulting trades | type        | tif     | 
      | aux     | ETH/DEC19 | buy  | 1      | 95    | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT  | TIF_GTC | 
      | aux     | ETH/DEC19 | sell | 1      | 105   | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT  | TIF_GTC | 

    # Trigger an auction to set the mark price
    Then traders place following orders with references:
      | trader  | market id | side | volume | price | resulting trades | type       | tif     | reference |
      | trader1 | ETH/DEC19 | buy  | 1      | 100   | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GFA | trader1-2 |
      | trader2 | ETH/DEC19 | sell | 1      | 100   | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GFA | trader2-2 |
    Then the opening auction period for market "ETH/DEC19" ends
    And the mark price for the market "ETH/DEC19" is "100"

    Then traders place following orders:
      | trader | market id | side | volume | price | resulting trades | type       | tif     |
      | edd    | ETH/DEC19 | sell | 10     | 101   | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |
      | edd    | ETH/DEC19 | sell | 12     | 102   | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |
      | edd    | ETH/DEC19 | sell | 13     | 103   | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |
      | edd    | ETH/DEC19 | sell | 14     | 104   | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |
      | edd    | ETH/DEC19 | sell | 15     | 105   | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |
      | barney | ETH/DEC19 | buy  | 10     | 99    | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |
      | barney | ETH/DEC19 | buy  | 12     | 98    | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |
      | barney | ETH/DEC19 | buy  | 13     | 97    | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |
      | barney | ETH/DEC19 | buy  | 14     | 96    | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |
      | barney | ETH/DEC19 | buy  | 15     | 95    | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |
    Then traders have the following account balances:
      | trader | asset | market id | margin | general |
      | edd    | BTC   | ETH/DEC19 | 571    | 429     |
      | barney | BTC   | ETH/DEC19 | 535    | 465     |
# next instruction will trade with edd
    Then traders place following orders:
      | trader | market id | side | volume | price | resulting trades | type        | tif     |
      | chris  | ETH/DEC19 | buy  | 10     | 0     | 1                | TYPE_MARKET | TIF_IOC |
    Then traders have the following account balances:
      | trader | asset | market id | margin | general |
      | edd    | BTC   | ETH/DEC19 | 571    | 429     |
      | chris  | BTC   | ETH/DEC19 | 109    | 891     |
# next instruction will trade with barney
    Then traders place following orders:
      | trader | market id | side | volume | price | resulting trades | type        | tif     |
      | chris  | ETH/DEC19 | sell | 10     | 0     | 1                | TYPE_MARKET | TIF_IOC |
    Then traders have the following account balances:
      | trader | asset | market id | margin | general |
      | chris  | BTC   | ETH/DEC19 | 0      | 980     |
      | barney | BTC   | ETH/DEC19 | 535    | 465     |
      | edd    | BTC   | ETH/DEC19 | 591    | 429     |
    Then the margins levels for the traders are:
      | trader | market id | maintenance | search | initial | release |
      | edd    | ETH/DEC19 | 502         | 552    | 602     | 702     |
      | barney | ETH/DEC19 | 451         | 496    | 541     | 631     |
      | chris  | ETH/DEC19 | 0           | 0      | 0       | 0       |
