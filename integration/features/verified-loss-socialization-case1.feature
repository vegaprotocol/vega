# setup accounts
    Given the traders deposit on asset's general account the following amount:
      | trader           | asset | amount    |
      | sellSideProvider | BTC   | 100000000 |
      | buySideProvider  | BTC   | 100000000 |
      | trader1          | BTC   | 5000      |
      | trader2          | BTC   | 50000     |
      | trader3          | BTC   | 50000     |
      | aux1             | BTC   | 100000000 |
      | aux2             | BTC   | 100000000 |
# setup order book
    When the traders place the following orders:
      | trader           | market id | side | volume | price | resulting trades | type       | tif     | reference       |
      | sellSideProvider | ETH/DEC19 | sell | 1000   | 120   | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | sell-provider-1 |
      | buySideProvider  | ETH/DEC19 | buy  | 1000   | 80    | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | buy-provider-1  |
      | aux1             | ETH/DEC19 | sell | 1      | 120   | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | aux-s-1         |
      | aux2             | ETH/DEC19 | buy  | 1      | 80    | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | aux-b-1         |
      | aux1             | ETH/DEC19 | sell | 1      | 100   | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | aux-s-2         |
      | aux2             | ETH/DEC19 | buy  | 1      | 100   | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | aux-b-2         |
    Then the opening auction period ends for market "ETH/DEC19"
    And the mark price should be "100" for the market "ETH/DEC19"
    And the trading mode should be "TRADING_MODE_CONTINUOUS" for the market "ETH/DEC19"
# trader 1 place an order + we check margins
    When the traders place the following orders:
      | trader  | market id | side | volume | price | resulting trades | type       | tif     | reference |
      | trader1 | ETH/DEC19 | sell | 100    | 100   | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | ref-1     |
    Then the trading mode should be "TRADING_MODE_CONTINUOUS" for the market "ETH/DEC19"
# then trader2 place an order, and we calculate the margins again
    When the traders place the following orders:
      | trader  | market id | side | volume | price | resulting trades | type       | tif     | reference |
      | trader2 | ETH/DEC19 | buy  | 100    | 100   | 1                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | ref-1     |
    Then the trading mode should be "TRADING_MODE_CONTINUOUS" for the market "ETH/DEC19"
# then we change the volume in the book
    Then the traders cancel the following orders:
      | trader           | reference       |
      | sellSideProvider | sell-provider-1 |
      | buySideProvider  | buy-provider-1  |
    Then the trading mode should be "TRADING_MODE_CONTINUOUS" for the market "ETH/DEC19"
    When the traders place the following orders:
      | trader           | market id | side | volume | price | resulting trades | type       | tif     | reference       |
      | sellSideProvider | ETH/DEC19 | sell | 1000   | 200   | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | sell-provider-2 |
      | buySideProvider  | ETH/DEC19 | buy  | 1000   | 80    | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | buy-provider-2  |
    Then the traders cancel the following orders:
      | trader | reference |
      | aux1   | aux-s-1   |
      | aux2   | aux-b-1   |
    Then the trading mode should be "TRADING_MODE_CONTINUOUS" for the market "ETH/DEC19"
    When the traders place the following orders:
      | trader  | market id | side | volume | price | resulting trades | type       | tif     | reference |
      | trader2 | ETH/DEC19 | buy  | 100    | 180   | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | ref-1     |
      | trader3 | ETH/DEC19 | sell | 100    | 180   | 1                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | ref-2     |
    Then the trading mode should be "TRADING_MODE_CONTINUOUS" for the market "ETH/DEC19"
    Then the traders should have the following profit and loss:
      | trader  | volume | unrealised pnl | realised pnl |
      | trader1 | 0      | 0              | -5000        |
      | trader2 | 200    | 8000           | -2970        |
      | trader3 | -100   | 0              | 0            |
    And the insurance pool balance should be "0" for the market "ETH/DEC19"
    And the cumulated balance for all accounts should be worth "400105000"
