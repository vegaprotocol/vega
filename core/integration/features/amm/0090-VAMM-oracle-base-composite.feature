    # Setting up the accounts and vAMM submission now is part of the background, because we'll be running scenarios 0090-VAMM-006 through 0090-VAMM-014 on this setup
    Given the parties deposit on asset's general account the following amount:
      | party  | asset | amount  |
      | lp1    | ETH   | 100000000000 |
      | lp2    | ETH   | 100000000000 |
      | lp3    | ETH   | 100000000000 |
      | party1 | ETH   | 100000000000 |
      | party2 | ETH   | 100000000000 |
      | party3 | ETH   | 100000000000 |
      | party4 | ETH   | 100000000000 |
      | party5 | ETH   | 100000000000 |
      | vamm1  | ETH   | 100000000000 |
      | vamm2  | ETH   | 100000000000 |
      | vamm3  | ETH   | 100000000000 |


    And the parties place the following orders:
      | party  | market id | side | volume | price | resulting trades | type       | tif     | reference |
      | party1 | ETH/MAR22 | buy  | 1      | 100   | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |           |
      | party2 | ETH/MAR22 | sell | 1      | 100   | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |           |
    When the opening auction period ends for market "ETH/MAR22"
    Then the following trades should be executed:
      | buyer  | price | size | seller |
      | party1 | 100   | 1    | party2 |


  @VAMM
  Scenario: 0090-VAMM-038 It's possible to setup the vAMM so that it uses one of the oracles already available for the market in which it operates for its `base price`. In that case the deployment attempt should be deferred until the next value is received from the oracle.

   Then the parties submit the following AMM:
      | party | market id | amount  | slippage | base | lower bound | upper bound | proposed fee | data source id                                                   |
      | vamm1 | ETH/MAR22 | 100000  | 0.05     | 0    | 95          | 105         | 0.03         | 3dad1506c9130ae64a1f3ab8f9bea4339396c77cc85a0c952d9c704d963fff12 |
    Then the AMM pool status should be:
      | party | market id | amount | status         | base | lower bound | upper bound | 
      | vamm1 | ETH/MAR22 | 100000 | STATUS_PENDING | 0    | 95          | 105         | 

    And set the following AMM sub account aliases:
      | party | market id | alias    |
      | vamm1 | ETH/MAR22 | vamm1-id |

    And the market data for the market "ETH/MAR22" should be:
      | mark price | trading mode             | best bid price | best offer price | best bid volume | best offer volume |
      | 100        | TRADING_MODE_CONTINUOUS  | 0              | 0                | 0               | 0                 |

    # now oracle data comes in for the perp, but this isn't the one driving the AMM
    When the oracles broadcast data with block time signed with "0xCAFECAFE1":
      | name             | value      | time offset |
      | perp.ETH.value   | 10100000   | -2s         |

    Then the AMM pool status should be:
      | party | market id | amount | status         | base | lower bound | upper bound | 
      | vamm1 | ETH/MAR22 | 100000 | STATUS_PENDING | 0    | 95          | 105         | 


    # now oracle data comes in for the composite price source
    When the oracles broadcast data with block time signed with "0xCAFECAFE2":
      | name            | value   | time offset |
      | price.USD.value | 10000000 | -1s         |


    Then the AMM pool status should be:
      | party | market id | amount | status         | base | lower bound | upper bound | 
      | vamm1 | ETH/MAR22 | 100000 | STATUS_ACTIVE  | 100  | 95          | 105         |
