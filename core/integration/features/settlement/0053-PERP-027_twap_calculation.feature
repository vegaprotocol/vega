        Given time is updated to "2020-10-16T00:00:00Z"
        And the perpetual oracles from "0xCAFECAFE1":

            | network.markPriceUpdateMaximumFrequency | 0s    |
        And the average block duration is "1"

    @Perpetual @twap
    Scenario: 0053-PERP-027 Internal and External TWAP calculation
        Given the following network parameters are set:
            | name                                    | value |
            | network.markPriceUpdateMaximumFrequency | 120s  |
        And the parties deposit on asset's general account the following amount:
            | party  | asset | amount    |
            | party1 | USD   | 10000000  |
            | party2 | USD   | 10000000  |

            | lpprov | USD   | 100000000 |

        When the parties submit the following liquidity provision:
            | id  | party  | market id | commitment amount | fee   | lp type    |
            | lp1 | lpprov | ETH/DEC19 | 100000            | 0.001 | submission |

        # move market to continuous
        And the parties place the following orders:
            | party  | market id | side | volume | price | resulting trades | type       | tif     |
            | lpprov | ETH/DEC19 | buy  | 1000   | 5     | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |

        And the market data for the market "ETH/DEC19" should be:
            | target stake | supplied stake |
            | 12100        | 100000         |
        Then the opening auction period ends for market "ETH/DEC19"

        Given the trading mode should be "TRADING_MODE_CONTINUOUS" for the market "ETH/DEC19"
        When time is updated to "2020-10-16T00:02:00Z"
