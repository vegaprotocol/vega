    # Setting up the accounts and vAMM submission now is part of the background, because we'll be running scenarios 0090-VAMM-006 through 0090-VAMM-014 on this setup
    Given the parties deposit on asset's general account the following amount:
      | party  | asset | amount  |
      | lp1    | USD   | 1000000 |
      | lp2    | USD   | 1000000 |
      | lp3    | USD   | 1000000 |
      | party1 | USD   | 1000000 |
      | party2 | USD   | 1000000 |
      | party3 | USD   | 1000000 |
      | party4 | USD   | 1000000 |
      | party5 | USD   | 1000000 |
      | vamm1  | USD   | 1000000 |

    When the parties submit the following liquidity provision:
      | id   | party | market id | commitment amount | fee   | lp type    |
      | lp_1 | lp1   | ETH/MAR22 | 600               | 0.04  | submission |
      | lp_2 | lp2   | ETH/MAR22 | 400               | 0.02 | submission |
    Then the network moves ahead "4" blocks
    And the current epoch is "0"

    And the parties place the following orders:
      | party  | market id | side | volume | price | resulting trades | type       | tif     | reference |
      | lp1    | ETH/MAR22 | buy  | 20     | 40    | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | lp1-b     |

      | lp2    | ETH/MAR22 | buy  | 500    | 80   | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC  | lp2-s     |
    When the opening auction period ends for market "ETH/MAR22"
    Then the following trades should be executed:
      | buyer  | price | size | seller |
      | party1 | 100   | 1    | party2 |

    And the market data for the market "ETH/MAR22" should be:
      | mark price | trading mode            | target stake | supplied stake | open interest | ref price | mid price | static mid price |
      | 100        | TRADING_MODE_CONTINUOUS | 39           | 1000           | 1             | 100       | 120       | 120              |

  @VAMM
  Scenario: 0090-VAMM-015: A vAMM which has been created and is active contributes with it's proposed fee level to the active fee setting mechanism.
    When the parties place the following orders:
      | party  | market id | side | volume | price | resulting trades | type       | tif     |
      | party4 | ETH/MAR22 | sell | 500    | 80    | 1                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |

    And the liquidity fee factor should be "0.02" for the market "ETH/MAR22"

    Then the market data for the market "ETH/MAR22" should be:
      | mark price | trading mode            | target stake | supplied stake | open interest | ref price | mid price | static mid price | best offer price | best bid price |
      | 100        | TRADING_MODE_CONTINUOUS | 20033        | 1000           | 501           | 100       | 100       | 100              | 160              | 40             |

    When the network moves ahead "4" blocks
    And the liquidity fee factor should be "0.04" for the market "ETH/MAR22"
  
    When the parties submit the following AMM:
      | party | market id | amount | slippage | base | lower bound | upper bound | lower leverage | upper leverage | proposed fee |
      | vamm1 | ETH/MAR22 | 100000 | 0.1      | 80   | 65          | 130         | 0.25           | 0.25           | 0.03         |
    Then the AMM pool status should be:
      | party | market id | amount | status        | base | lower bound | upper bound | lower leverage | upper leverage |
      | vamm1 | ETH/MAR22 | 100000 | STATUS_ACTIVE | 80   | 65          | 130         | 0.25           | 0.25           |

    And set the following AMM sub account aliases:
      | party | market id | alias    |
      | vamm1 | ETH/MAR22 | vamm1-id |
    And the following transfers should happen:
      | from  | from account         | to       | to account           | market id | amount | asset | is amm | type                  |
      | vamm1 | ACCOUNT_TYPE_GENERAL | vamm1-id | ACCOUNT_TYPE_GENERAL |           | 100000 | USD   | true   | TRANSFER_TYPE_AMM_LOW |

    When the network moves ahead "4" blocks
    And the liquidity fee factor should be "0.03" for the market "ETH/MAR22"
