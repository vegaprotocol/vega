    # the lp1 one volume on this side should go to 801 but because price monitoring bound is still 900 it gets pushed to 900.
    # but 900 is no longer the best bid, so the risk model is used to get prob of trading. This now given by the log-normal model
    # Hence a bit volume is required to meet commitment and thus the margin requirement moves but not much.
