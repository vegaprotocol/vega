Feature: Position resolution case 4

  Background:
    Given the insurance pool initial balance for the markets is "0":
    And the execution engine have these markets:
      | name      | quote name | asset | mark price | risk model | lamd/long | tau/short | mu/max move up | r/min move down | sigma | release factor | initial factor | search factor | settlement price | auction duration | maker fee | infrastructure fee | liquidity fee | p. m. update freq. | p. m. horizons | p. m. probs | p. m. durations | prob. of trading |
      | ETH/DEC19 | BTC        | BTC   | 94         | simple     | 0         | 0         | 0              | 0.016           | 2.0   | 5              | 4              | 3.2           | 42               | 0                | 0         | 0                  | 0             | 0                  |                |             |                 | 0.1              |

  Scenario: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bYWbNJvG7E-tcqsK26JMu2uGwaqXqm0L/view
# setup accounts
    Given the following traders:
      | name             |        amount |
      | sellSideProvider | 1000000000000 |
      | buySideProvider  | 1000000000000 |
      | designatedLooser |         10000 |
    Then I Expect the traders to have new general account:
      | name             | asset |
      | designatedLooser | BTC   |
      | sellSideProvider | BTC   |
      | buySideProvider  | BTC   |

# insurance pool generation - setup orderbook
    Then traders place following orders with references:
      | trader           | id        | type | volume | price | resulting trades | type  | tif | reference       |
      | sellSideProvider | ETH/DEC19 | sell |    150 |   200 |                0 | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | sell-provider-1 |
      | buySideProvider  | ETH/DEC19 | buy  |     50 |   190 |                0 | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | buy-provider-1  |
      | buySideProvider  | ETH/DEC19 | buy  |     50 |   180 |                0 | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | buy-provider-2  |

# insurance pool generation - trade
    Then traders place following orders:
      | trader           | id        | type | volume | price | resulting trades | type  | tif |
      | designatedLooser | ETH/DEC19 | sell |    100 |   180 |                2 | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |

    Then the margins levels for the traders are:
      | trader           | id        | maintenance | search | initial | release |
      | designatedLooser | ETH/DEC19 |        2000 |   6400 |    8000 |   10000 |

# insurance pool generation - modify order book
    Then traders cancels the following orders reference:
      | trader           | reference       |
      | sellSideProvider | sell-provider-1 |

# add back some volume on the sell side
    Then traders place following orders with references:
      | trader           | id        | type | volume | price | resulting trades | type  | tif | reference       |
      | sellSideProvider | ETH/DEC19 | sell |    150 |   350 |                0 | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | sell-provider-2 |

# insurance pool generation - set new mark price (and trigger closeout)
    Then traders place following orders:
      | trader           | id        | type | volume | price | resulting trades | type  | tif |
      | sellSideProvider | ETH/DEC19 | sell |      1 |   300 |                0 | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |
      | buySideProvider  | ETH/DEC19 | buy  |      1 |   300 |                1 | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |

    And the mark price for the market "ETH/DEC19" is "300"

#check positions
   Then position API produce the following:
     | trader           | volume | unrealisedPNL | realisedPNL |
     | designatedLooser |      0 |             0 |      -10000 |
     | buySideProvider  |    101 |         11500 |       -1500 |

# checking margins
    Then I expect the trader to have a margin:
      | trader           | asset | id        | margin | general |
      | designatedLooser | BTC   | ETH/DEC19 |      0 |       0 |

# then we make sure the insurance pool collected the funds
    And the insurance pool balance is "0" for the market "ETH/DEC19"


# now we check what's left in the orderbook
# we expect 50 orders to be left there on the sell side
# we buy a first time 50 to consume the book
# then try to buy 1 again -> result in no trades -> sell side empty.
# Try to sell one for low price -> no trades -> buy side empty -> order book empty.
   Then traders place following orders:
      | trader          | id        | type   | volume | price | resulting trades | type  | tif |
      | buySideProvider | ETH/DEC19 | buy    |     50 |   350 |                1 | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_FOK |
      | buySideProvider | ETH/DEC19 | buy    |      1 |   350 |                0 | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_FOK |
      | sellSideProvider | ETH/DEC19 | sell  |      1 |   1   |                0 | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_FOK |
