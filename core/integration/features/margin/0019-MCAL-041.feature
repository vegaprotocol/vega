Feature: Test order margin during auction
  Background:
    # Set liquidity parameters to allow "zero" target-stake which is needed to construct the order-book defined in the ACs
    Given the following network parameters are set:
      | name                                    | value |
      | network.markPriceUpdateMaximumFrequency | 0s    |
    And the liquidity monitoring parameters:
      | name       | triggering ratio | time window | scaling factor |
      | lqm-params | 0.00             | 24h         | 1e-9           |
    And the simple risk model named "simple-risk-model":
      | long | short | max move up | min move down | probability of trading |
      | 0.1  | 0.1   | 100         | -100          | 0.2                    |
    And the markets:
      | id        | quote name | asset | liquidity monitoring | risk model        | margin calculator         | auction duration | fees         | price monitoring | data source config     | linear slippage factor | quadratic slippage factor | sla params      |

    And the following network parameters are set:
      | name                           | value |
      | market.auction.minimumDuration | 2     |
    Given the average block duration is "1"
