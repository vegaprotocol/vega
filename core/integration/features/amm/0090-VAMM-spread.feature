    # Setting up the accounts and vAMM submission now is part of the background, because we'll be running scenarios 0090-VAMM-006 through 0090-VAMM-014 on this setup
    Given the parties deposit on asset's general account the following amount:
      | party  | asset | amount  |
      | lp1    | USD   | 1000000 |
      | lp2    | USD   | 1000000 |
      | lp3    | USD   | 1000000 |
      | party1 | USD   | 1000000 |
      | party2 | USD   | 1000000 |
      | party3 | USD   | 1000000 |

      | vamm2  | USD   | 1000000 |
      | vamm3  | USD   | 1000000 |


    And the parties place the following orders:
      | party  | market id | side | volume | price | resulting trades | type       | tif     | reference |
      | lp1    | ETH/MAR22 | buy  | 20     | 40    | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | lp1-b     |

    When the opening auction period ends for market "ETH/MAR22"
    Then the following trades should be executed:
      | buyer  | price | size | seller |
      | party1 | 100   | 1    | party2 |


    Then the parties submit the following AMM:
      | party | market id | amount | slippage | base | lower bound | upper bound | proposed fee | spread |
      | vamm1 | ETH/MAR22 | 100000  | 0.05    | 100  | 95          | 105         | 0.03         | 0.02   |
    Then the AMM pool status should be:
      | party | market id | amount | status        | base | lower bound | upper bound | 
      | vamm1 | ETH/MAR22 | 100000 | STATUS_ACTIVE | 100  | 95          | 105         | 

    And set the following AMM sub account aliases:
      | party | market id | alias    |
      | vamm1 | ETH/MAR22 | vamm1-id |

    And the market data for the market "ETH/MAR22" should be:
      | mark price | trading mode             | best bid price | best offer price | best bid volume | best offer volume |
      | 100        | TRADING_MODE_CONTINUOUS  | 98             | 102              | 209             | 183               |

  @VAMM
  Scenario: Incoming order at AMM best price

  # AMM's has a BUY at 98 so a SELL will not match because of the AMM's spread
  When the parties place the following orders:
      | party  | market id | side | volume | price | resulting trades | type       | tif     | reference |
      | party1 | ETH/MAR22 | sell | 1      | 99    | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_IOC |           |

  When the parties place the following orders:

      | party1 | ETH/MAR22 | sell | 1      | 98    | 1                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |           |

  Then the following trades should be executed:
      | buyer     | price | size | seller    | is amm |
