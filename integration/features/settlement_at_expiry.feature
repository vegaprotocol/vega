      | name                           | value |
      | market.auction.minimumDuration | 1     |

  Scenario: Order cannot be placed once the market is expired
    Given the parties deposit on asset's general account the following amount:
      | party  | asset | amount |
      | party1 | ETH   | 10000  |
      | aux1    | ETH   | 100000 |
      | aux2    | ETH   | 100000 |

    # place auxiliary orders so we always have best bid and best offer as to not trigger the liquidity auction
    When the parties place the following orders:
      | party | market id | side | volume | price | resulting trades | type       | tif     | reference |
      | aux1   | ETH/DEC19 | buy  | 1      | 999   | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | ref-1     |

    And the mark price should be "1000" for the market "ETH/DEC19"

    # Set mark price
    Then the parties place the following orders:
