  Background:
    Given the insurance pool initial balance for the markets is "0":
    And the execution engine have these markets:
      | name      | quote name | asset | mark price | risk model | tau/short | lamd/long | mu/max move up | r/min move down | sigma | release factor | initial factor | search factor | settlement price | auction duration | maker fee | infrastructure fee | liquidity fee | p. m. update freq. | p. m. horizons | p. m. probs | p. m. durations | prob. of trading |
      | ETH/DEC19 | ETH        | ETH   | 9400000    | simple     | 0.1       | 0.2       | 0              | 0               | 0     | 5              | 4              | 3.2           | 940000           | 0                | 0         | 0                  | 0             | 0                  |                |             |                 | 0.1              |
    And the following traders:
      | name       | amount       |
      | trader1    | 1000000000   |
      | sellSideMM | 100000000000 |
      | buySideMM  | 100000000000 |
    # setting mark price
    And traders place following orders:
      | trader     | market id | type | volume | price    | trades | type  | tif |
      | sellSideMM | ETH/DEC19 | sell | 1      | 10300000 | 0      | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |
      | buySideMM  | ETH/DEC19 | buy  | 1      | 10300000 | 1      | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |


    # setting order book
    And traders place following orders with references:
      | trader     | market id | type | volume | price    | trades | type  | tif | reference |
      | sellSideMM | ETH/DEC19 | sell | 10     | 15000000 | 0      | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | sell1     |
      | sellSideMM | ETH/DEC19 | sell | 14     | 14000000 | 0      | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | sell2     |
      | sellSideMM | ETH/DEC19 | sell | 2      | 11200000 | 0      | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | sell3     |
      | buySideMM  | ETH/DEC19 | buy  | 1      | 10000000 | 0      | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | buy1      |
      | buySideMM  | ETH/DEC19 | buy  | 3      | 9600000  | 0      | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | buy2      |
      | buySideMM  | ETH/DEC19 | buy  | 9      | 9000000  | 0      | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | buy3      |
      | buySideMM  | ETH/DEC19 | buy  | 50     | 8700000  | 0      | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | buy4      |


  Scenario:
    # MAKE TRADES
    Given I Expect the traders to have new general account:
      | name    | asset |
      | trader1 | ETH   |
    # no margin account created for trader1, just general account
    And "trader1" have only one account per asset
    # placing test order
    Then traders place following orders:
      | trader  | market id | type | volume | price   | trades | type  | tif |
      | trader1 | ETH/DEC19 | sell | 13     | 9000000 | 3      | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |
    And "trader1" general account for asset "ETH" balance is "718400040"
    And executed trades:
      | buyer     | price    | size | seller  |
      | buySideMM | 10000000 | 1    | trader1 |
      | buySideMM | 9600000  | 3    | trader1 |
      | buySideMM | 9000000  | 9    | trader1 |
    Then the following transfers happened:
      | from   | to      | fromType                | toType              | id        | amount  | asset |
      | market | trader1 | ACCOUNT_TYPE_SETTLEMENT | ACCOUNT_TYPE_MARGIN | ETH/DEC19 | 2800000 | ETH   |

    And I expect the trader to have a margin:
      | trader  | asset | market id | margin    | general   |
      | trader1 | ETH   | ETH/DEC19 | 284399960 | 718400040 |
    And the margins levels for the traders are:
      | trader  | market id | maintenance | search    | initial   | release   |
      | trader1 | ETH/DEC19 | 71099990    | 227519968 | 284399960 | 355499950 |
    And position API produce the following:
      | trader  | volume | unrealisedPNL | realisedPNL |
      | trader1 | -13    | 2800000       | 0           |

    # NEW ORDERS ADDED WITHOUT ANOTHER TRADE HAPPENING
    Then traders cancels the following orders reference:
      | trader     | reference |
      | buySideMM  | buy4      |
      | sellSideMM | sell2     |
      | sellSideMM | sell3     |
    And traders place following orders:
      | trader     | market id | type | volume | price    | trades | type  | tif |
      | buySideMM  | ETH/DEC19 | buy  | 45     | 7000000  | 0      | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |
      | buySideMM  | ETH/DEC19 | buy  | 50     | 7500000  | 0      | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |
      | sellSideMM | ETH/DEC19 | sell | 14     | 10000000 | 0      | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |
      | sellSideMM | ETH/DEC19 | sell | 2      | 8000000  | 0      | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |
    And I expect the trader to have a margin:
      | trader  | asset | market id | margin    | general   |
      | trader1 | ETH   | ETH/DEC19 | 284399960 | 718400040 |
    And the margins levels for the traders are:
      | trader  | market id | maintenance | search    | initial   | release   |
      | trader1 | ETH/DEC19 | 71099990    | 227519968 | 284399960 | 355499950 |
    And position API produce the following:
      | trader  | volume | unrealisedPNL | realisedPNL |
      | trader1 | -13    | 2800000       | 0           |

    # ANOTHER TRADE HAPPENING (BY A DIFFERENT PARTY)
    # updating mark price to 300
    Then traders place following orders:
      | trader     | market id | type | volume | price    | trades | type  | tif |
      | sellSideMM | ETH/DEC19 | sell | 50     | 30000000 | 0      | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |
      | buySideMM  | ETH/DEC19 | buy  | 27     | 30000000 | 4      | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |

    # MTM
    And the following transfers happened:
      | from    | to      | fromType             | toType                  | id        | amount    | asset |

      | trader1 | trader1 | ACCOUNT_TYPE_GENERAL | ACCOUNT_TYPE_MARGIN     | ETH/DEC19 | 144600040 | ETH   |

    And I expect the trader to have a margin:
      | trader  | asset | market id | margin    | general   |
      | trader1 | ETH   | ETH/DEC19 | 156000000 | 573800000 |

      | trader1 | -13    | -270200000    | 0           |

    # ENTER SEARCH LEVEL (& DEPLEAT GENERAL ACCOUNT)
    Then traders place following orders:
      | trader     | market id | type | volume | price    | trades | type  | tif |
      | sellSideMM | ETH/DEC19 | sell | 11     | 50000000 | 0      | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |
      | buySideMM  | ETH/DEC19 | buy  | 50     | 50000000 | 2      | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |

      | trader1 | -13    | -530200000    | 0           |

    # FORCED CLOSEOUT
