    # Setting up the accounts and vAMM submission now is part of the background, because we'll be running scenarios 0090-VAMM-006 through 0090-VAMM-014 on this setup
    Given the parties deposit on asset's general account the following amount:
      | party  | asset | amount  |
      | lp1    | USD   | 1000000 |
      | lp2    | USD   | 1000000 |

      | party5 | USD   | 1000000 |
      | vamm1  | USD   | 1000000 |

    When the parties submit the following liquidity provision:
      | id   | party | market id | commitment amount | fee   | lp type    |
      | lp_1 | lp1   | ETH/MAR22 | 600               | 0.02  | submission |
      | lp_2 | lp2   | ETH/MAR22 | 400               | 0.015 | submission |
    Then the network moves ahead "4" blocks
    And the current epoch is "0"

    And the parties place the following orders:
      | party  | market id | side | volume | price | resulting trades | type       | tif     | reference |
      | lp1    | ETH/MAR22 | buy  | 20     | 40    | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | lp1-b     |

    When the opening auction period ends for market "ETH/MAR22"
    Then the following trades should be executed:
      | buyer  | price | size | seller |
      | party1 | 100   | 1    | party2 |

    And the market data for the market "ETH/MAR22" should be:
      | mark price | trading mode            | target stake | supplied stake | open interest | ref price | mid price | static mid price |
      | 100        | TRADING_MODE_CONTINUOUS | 39           | 1000           | 1             | 100       | 100       | 100              |
    When the parties submit the following AMM:

    And set the following AMM sub account aliases:
      | party | market id | alias    |
      | vamm1 | ETH/MAR22 | vamm1-id |
    And the following transfers should happen:
      | from  | from account         | to       | to account           | market id | amount | asset | is amm | type                             |

  @VAMM
  Scenario: 0090-VAMM-020: If a vAMM is cancelled and set in Reduce-Only mode when it is currently long, then It creates no further buy orders even if the current price is above the configured lower price. When one of it's sell orders is executed it still does not produce buy orders, and correctly quotes sell orders from a higher price. When the position reaches 0 the vAMM is closed and all funds are released to the user after the next mark to market.
    # based on 0090-VAMM-007
    When the parties place the following orders:
      | party  | market id | side | volume | price | resulting trades | type       | tif     |

    # see the trades that make the vAMM go long
    Then the following trades should be executed:
      | buyer    | price | size | seller | is amm |
      | vamm1-id | 105   | 350  | party4 | true   |
    And the network moves ahead "1" blocks
    Then the market data for the market "ETH/MAR22" should be:

      | 105        | TRADING_MODE_CONTINUOUS | 90        | 90               |
	Then the parties should have the following profit and loss:

      | vamm1-id | USD   | ETH/MAR22 | 28900   | 71247  | true   |

    # Next: cancel the vAMM with reduce-only
    When the parties cancel the following AMM:
      | party | market id | method             |
      | vamm1 | ETH/MAR22 | METHOD_REDUCE_ONLY |
    Then the AMM pool status should be:

    # Check if the vAMM doesn't place any more buy orders: submit sell orders at previous best bid, ask, and mid prices:

    # check the state of the market, trigger MTM settlement and check balances before closing out the last 100 for the vAMM
    When the network moves ahead "1" blocks

  @VAMM
  Scenario: 0090-VAMM-020: Same as the test above, only the final buy order that moves the vAMM position to 0 is more than big enough, and doesn't cause the vAMM to flip position from long to short.
    # based on 0090-VAMM-007

      | vamm1-id | 105   | 350  | party4 | true   |
