Feature: Staking & Delegation 

  Background:
    Given the following network parameters are set:
      | name                                              | value  |
      | reward.asset                                      | VEGA   |
      | validators.epoch.length                           | 120s   |
      | validators.delegation.minAmount                   | 10     |
      | reward.staking.delegation.payoutDelay             |  0s    |
      | reward.staking.delegation.delegatorShare          |  0.883 |
      | reward.staking.delegation.minimumValidatorStake   |  100   |
      | reward.staking.delegation.payoutFraction          |  0.5   |
      | reward.staking.delegation.maxPayoutPerParticipant | 100000 |
      | reward.staking.delegation.competitionLevel        |  1.1   |
      | reward.staking.delegation.maxPayoutPerEpoch       |  50000 |
      | reward.staking.delegation.minValidators           |  5     |


    Given time is updated to "2021-08-26T00:00:00Z"
    Given the average block duration is "2"

    And the validators:
      | id     | staking account balance |
      | node1  |         1000000         |
      | node2  |         1000000         |
      | node3  |         1000000         |
      | node4  |         1000000         |
      | node5  |         1000000         |
      | node6  |         1000000         |
      | node7  |         1000000         |
      | node8  |         1000000         |
      | node9  |         1000000         |
      | node10 |         1000000         |
      | node11 |         1000000         |
      | node12 |         1000000         |
      | node13 |         1000000         |

    #set up the self delegation of the validators
    Then the parties submit the following delegations:
      | party  | node id  | amount |
      | node1  |  node1   | 10000  | 
      | node2  |  node2   | 10000  |       
      | node3  |  node3   | 10000  | 
      | node4  |  node4   | 10000  | 
      | node5  |  node5   | 10000  | 
      | node6  |  node6   | 10000  | 
      | node7  |  node7   | 10000  | 
      | node8  |  node8   | 10000  | 
      | node9  |  node9   | 10000  | 
      | node10 |  node10  | 10000  | 
      | node11 |  node11  | 10000  | 
      | node12 |  node12  | 10000  | 
      | node13 |  node13  | 10000  | 

    And the parties deposit on staking account the following amount:  
      | party  | asset  | amount |
      | party1 | VEGA   | 700  |
      | party2 | VEGA   | 20000  |


    When the parties submit the following delegations:
    | party  | node id  | amount |
    | party1 |  node1   |  100   | 
    | party1 |  node2   |  200   |       
    | party1 |  node3   |  300   |     
    | party2 |  node2   |  400   |     
    | party2 |  node3   |  500   |     
    | party2 |  node4   |  600   |     

    #complete the first epoch for the self delegation to take effect
    Then the network moves ahead "63" blocks

  Scenario: Party dissociation gets reconciled during the epoch
    Description: A party with delegation dissociates all of their tokens which causes their whole delegation to be undone within 30 seconds and reflected before the epoch ends
    | party  | node id  | amount |
    | party1 |  node1   | 100    | 
    | party1 |  node2   | 200    |       
    | party1 |  node3   | 300    |   
    | party2 |  node2   | 400    |   
    | party2 |  node3   | 500    |   
    | party2 |  node4   | 600    |   

    Given the parties withdraw from staking account the following amount:  
    | party  | asset  | amount |
    | party1 | VEGA   |  700   | 

    Then the parties should have the following delegation balances for epoch 1:
    | party  | node id  | amount |
    | party1 |  node1   | 100    | 
    | party1 |  node2   | 200    |       
    | party1 |  node3   | 300    |   
    | party2 |  node2   | 400    |   
    | party2 |  node3   | 500    |   
    | party2 |  node4   | 600    |  

    When the network moves ahead "16" blocks
    Then the parties should have the following delegation balances for epoch 1:
    | party  | node id  | amount |
    | party1 |  node1   | 0      | 
    | party1 |  node2   | 0      |       
    | party1 |  node3   | 0      |   
    | party2 |  node2   | 400    |   
    | party2 |  node3   | 500    |   
    | party2 |  node4   | 600    |  

    Then the parties should have the following delegation balances for epoch 2:
    | party  | node id  | amount |
    | party1 |  node1   | 0      | 
    | party1 |  node2   | 0      |       
    | party1 |  node3   | 0      |  
    | party2 |  node2   | 400    |   
    | party2 |  node3   | 500    |   
    | party2 |  node4   | 600    |   

    When the network moves ahead "47" blocks
    Then the parties should have the following delegation balances for epoch 1:
    | party  | node id  | amount |
    | party1 |  node1   | 0      | 
    | party1 |  node2   | 0      |       
    | party1 |  node3   | 0      |

    | party2 |  node3   | 500    |   
    | party2 |  node4   | 600    |  

    Then the parties should have the following delegation balances for epoch 2:
    | party  | node id  | amount |
    | party1 |  node1   | 0      | 
    | party1 |  node2   | 0      |       
    | party1 |  node3   | 0      |   
    | party2 |  node2   | 400    |   
    | party2 |  node3   | 500    |   
    | party2 |  node4   | 600    |  

  Scenario: Party dissociation gets reconciled during the epoch incrementally
    Description: A party with delegation dissociates some tokens in multiple withdrawals which causes their whole delegation to be undone within 30 seconds and reflected before the epoch ends
   
    Given the parties submit the following undelegations:
    | party  | node id  | amount |  when         |
    | party1 |  node1   |  100   |  end of epoch |      

    #epoch 1 withdraw 100 
    Given the parties withdraw from staking account the following amount:  
    | party  | asset  | amount |
    | party1 | VEGA   |  100   | 

    When the network moves ahead "2" blocks

    #epoch 1 withdraw another 300 - in total 400 meaning only 300 remain associated
    Given the parties withdraw from staking account the following amount:  
    | party  | asset  | amount |
    | party1 | VEGA   |  300   | 

    When the network moves ahead "14" blocks

    # within 30 seconds we expect to have seen events of the nomination corrected accordingly
    Then the parties should have the following delegation balances for epoch 1:
    | party  | node id  | amount |
    | party1 |  node1   | 50     | 
    | party1 |  node2   | 100    |       
    | party1 |  node3   | 150    |   
    | party2 |  node2   | 400    |   
    | party2 |  node3   | 500    |   
    | party2 |  node4   | 600    | 

    #no changes in these 30 seconds so expect balances to not change 
    When the network moves ahead "15" blocks
    Then the parties should have the following delegation balances for epoch 1:
    | party  | node id  | amount |
    | party1 |  node1   | 50     | 
    | party1 |  node2   | 100    |

    | party2 |  node3   | 500    |   
    | party2 |  node4   | 600    |  

    #still in epoch 1 withdraw the remaining 300 tokens
    Given the parties withdraw from staking account the following amount:  
    | party  | asset  | amount |
    | party1 | VEGA   |  300   | 

    When the network moves ahead "16" blocks
    Then the parties should have the following delegation balances for epoch 1:

    | party2 |  node3   | 500    |   
    | party2 |  node4   | 600    |  

    # the adjustment should be published for the next epoch as well 
    Then the parties should have the following delegation balances for epoch 2:
    | party  | node id  | amount |
    | party1 |  node1   | 0      | 
    | party1 |  node2   | 0      |
