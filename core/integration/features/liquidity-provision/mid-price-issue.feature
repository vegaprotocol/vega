  Background:
    Given the following assets are registered:
      | id  | decimal places |
      | DAI | 5              |
    And the log normal risk model named "dai-lognormal-risk":
      | risk aversion | tau         | mu | r | sigma |
      | 0.00001       | 0.000114077 | 0  | 0 | 0.41  |
    And the markets:
      | id        | quote name | asset | risk model         | margin calculator         | auction duration | fees         | price monitoring | data source config     | decimal places | linear slippage factor | quadratic slippage factor |

    And the following network parameters are set:
      | name                                    | value |
      | market.auction.minimumDuration          | 1     |

  @MidPrice
  Scenario: Mid price works as expected
    Given the parties deposit on asset's general account the following amount:
      | party  | asset | amount       |
      | party1 | DAI   | 110000000000 |
      | party2 | DAI   | 110000000000 |

      | lp1 | party1 | DAI/DEC22 | 20000000000       | 0.01 | lp-1      | submission |
    And the parties place the following pegged iceberg orders:
      | party  | market id | peak size | minimum visible size | side | pegged reference | volume     | offset |
      | party1 | DAI/DEC22 | 2         | 1                    | buy  | MID              | 1          | 10     |

    And the opening auction period ends for market "DAI/DEC22"
    Then the following trades should be executed:
      | buyer  | price      | size | seller |
      | party2 | 3500000000 | 1    | party3 |
    And the market data for the market "DAI/DEC22" should be:

  Scenario: Changing orders copying the script (same as above, but LP low buy order)
    Given the parties deposit on asset's general account the following amount:

      | party1 | DAI   | 110000000000 |
      | party2 | DAI   | 110000000000 |

    And the parties submit the following liquidity provision:

      | lp1 | party1 | DAI/DEC22 | 10000000000       | 0.01 | buy  | MID              | 1          | 10000000 | lp-1      | submission |

    # party1 has no limit sell order so automatically deployed volume at 4510000000 goes up (compared to previous scenario)
