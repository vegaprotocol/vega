Feature: Position resolution case 1 

  Background:

    And the markets:
      | id        | quote name | asset | risk model                  | margin calculator                  | auction duration | fees         | price monitoring | data source config          |
      | ETH/DEC19 | BTC        | BTC   | default-simple-risk-model-2 | default-overkill-margin-calculator | 1                | default-none | default-none     | default-eth-for-future |
    And the following network parameters are set:
      | name                           | value |
      | market.auction.minimumDuration | 1     |

  Scenario: close out when there is not enough orders on the orderbook to cover the position (0008-TRAD-001, 0008-TRAD-002, 0008-TRAD-005)
  # setup accounts
    Given the parties deposit on asset's general account the following amount:
      | party            | asset | amount        |
      | sellSideProvider | BTC   | 1000000000000 |
      | buySideProvider  | BTC   | 1000000000000 |
      | designatedLooser | BTC   | 11600         |
      | aux              | BTC   | 1000000000000 |
      | aux2             | BTC   | 1000000000000 |

# place auxiliary orders so we always have best bid and best offer as to not trigger the liquidity auction
    Then the parties place the following orders:
      | party | market id | side | volume | price | resulting trades | type       | tif     |
      | aux   | ETH/DEC19 | buy  | 10     | 1     | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |
      | aux   | ETH/DEC19 | sell | 10     | 2000  | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |
      | aux   | ETH/DEC19 | buy  | 1      | 150   | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |
      | aux2  | ETH/DEC19 | sell | 1      | 150   | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |
    Then the opening auction period ends for market "ETH/DEC19"
    And the mark price should be "150" for the market "ETH/DEC19"
    And the trading mode should be "TRADING_MODE_CONTINUOUS" for the market "ETH/DEC19"

# insurance pool generation - setup orderbook
    When the parties place the following orders:
      | party            | market id | side | volume | price | resulting trades | type       | tif     | reference       |
      | sellSideProvider | ETH/DEC19 | sell | 290    | 150   | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | sell-provider-1 |
      | buySideProvider  | ETH/DEC19 | buy  | 1      | 140   | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | buy-provider-1  |

# insurance pool generation - trade
    When the parties place the following orders:
      | party            | market id | side | volume | price | resulting trades | type       | tif     | reference |
      | designatedLooser | ETH/DEC19 | buy  | 290    | 150   | 1                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | ref-1     |

    # margin level: vol* slippage = vol * (MarkPrice-ExitPrice) =290 * (150-(1*10+140*1)/11) = 290*137 = 39700

    Then the parties should have the following account balances:
      | party            | asset | market id | margin    | general  |
      | designatedLooser | BTC   | ETH/DEC19 | 11600     | 0        |

    And the parties should have the following margin levels:
      | party            | market id | maintenance | search    | initial   | release |
      | designatedLooser | ETH/DEC19 | 39730       | 127136    | 158920    | 198650  |

# insurance pool generation - modify order book
    Then the parties cancel the following orders:
      | party           | reference      |
      | buySideProvider | buy-provider-1 |
    When the parties place the following orders:
      | party           | market id | side | volume | price | resulting trades | type       | tif     | reference      |
      | buySideProvider | ETH/DEC19 | buy  | 1      | 40    | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | buy-provider-2 |

# insurance pool generation - set new mark price (and trigger closeout)  
    When the parties place the following orders:
      | party            | market id | side | volume | price | resulting trades | type       | tif     | reference |
      | sellSideProvider | ETH/DEC19 | sell | 1      | 120   | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | ref-1     |
      | buySideProvider  | ETH/DEC19 | buy  | 1      | 120   | 1                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | ref-2     |

# margin level: vol* slippage = vol * (MarkPrice-ExitPrice) =290 * (120-(1*10+40*1)/11) = 290*116 = 33640

    Then the parties should have the following account balances:
      | party            | asset | market id | margin    | general  |
      | designatedLooser | BTC   | ETH/DEC19 | 2900      | 0        |

    And the parties should have the following margin levels:
      | party            | market id | maintenance | search    | initial   | release |
      | designatedLooser | ETH/DEC19 | 33640       | 107648    | 134560    | 168200  |
# check positions
    Then the parties should have the following profit and loss:
      | party            | volume | unrealised pnl | realised pnl |
      | designatedLooser | 290    | -8700          | 0            |

# checking margins
    Then the parties should have the following account balances:
      | party            | asset | market id | margin | general |
      | designatedLooser | BTC   | ETH/DEC19 | 2900   | 0       |

# then we make sure the insurance pool collected the funds
    And the insurance pool balance should be "0" for the market "ETH/DEC19"
