Feature: Price change amends specifying a new price which is not an integer multiple of the markets tick size should be rejected and the original order should be left in place

  Background:
    Given the following assets are registered:

      | ETH | 18             |
      | USD | 0              |
    And the perpetual oracles from "0xCAFECAFE1":

    And the average block duration is "1"

    # All parties have 1,000,000.000,000,000,000,000,000
    # Add as many parties as needed here
    And the parties deposit on asset's general account the following amount:
      | party   | asset | amount                     |
      | lpprov  | ETH   | 10000000000000000000000000 |

      | trader5 | ETH   | 10000000000000000000000000 |

  Scenario: 001 Create a new market, leave opening auction, attempt to amend an order to an invalid price (0004-AMND-060)
    # the amount ought to be 390,500.000,000,000,000,000,000
    Given the parties submit the following liquidity provision:
      | id  | party  | market id | commitment amount | fee | lp type    |
      | lp1 | lpprov | ETH/DEC19 | 3905000000000000  | 0.3 | submission |
    And the parties place the following pegged iceberg orders:
      | party  | market id | peak size        | minimum visible size | side | pegged reference | volume           | offset | reference   |
      | lpprov | ETH/DEC19 | 4000000000000000 | 3905000000000000     | buy  | BID              | 4000000000000000 | 2      | lp-ice-buy  |

    And the parties place the following orders:
      | party   | market id | side | volume | price  | resulting trades | type       | tif     | reference |
      | trader1 | ETH/DEC19 | buy  | 5      | 902    | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | t1-b-1    |

    When the opening auction period ends for market "ETH/DEC19"
    Then the market data for the market "ETH/DEC19" should be:
      | mark price | trading mode            | auction trigger             | target stake | supplied stake   | open interest |
      | 976        | TRADING_MODE_CONTINUOUS | AUCTION_TRIGGER_UNSPECIFIED | 134907600000 | 3905000000000000 | 5             |

    When the parties amend the following orders:
      | party   | reference | price | size delta | tif     | error                              |
      | trader1 | t1-b-1    | 903  | 0           | TIF_GTC | OrderError: price not in tick size |
    And the network moves ahead "1" blocks

    Then the orders should have the following states:
      | party | market id   | reference   | side | volume | remaining | price | status        |
      | trader1 | ETH/DEC19 | t1-b-1      | buy  | 5      | 5         | 902   | STATUS_ACTIVE |
