      | ETH/DEC19 | BTC        | BTC   | simple     | 0         | 0         | 0              | 0.016           | 2.0   | 5              | 4              | 3.2           | 0                | 0         | 0                  | 0             | 0                  |                |             |                 | 0.1              | 0xDEADBEEF,0xCAFEDOOD | prices.ETH.value     | TYPE_INTEGER              | prices.ETH.value    |
    And oracles broadcast data signed with "0xDEADBEEF":
      | name             | value |
      | prices.ETH.value | 42    |
