  @Liquidation
  Scenario: using lognormal risk model, set "designatedLoser" closeout while the position of "designatedLoser" is not fully covered by orders on the order book; and check the funding of treasury. 0012-POSR-002, 0012-POSR-005, 0013-ACCT-001, 0013-ACCT-022

    # setup accounts
    Given the parties deposit on asset's general account the following amount:

      | lpprov           | USD   | 1000000000000 |

    Then the parties submit the following liquidity provision:

    # place auxiliary orders so we always have best bid and best offer as to not trigger the liquidity auction
    Then the parties place the following orders:
