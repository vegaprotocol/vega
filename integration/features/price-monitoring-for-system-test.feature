Feature: Price monitoring test using forward risk model (bounds for the valid price moves around price of 100000 for the two horizons are: [99845,100156], [99711,100290])

  Background:
    Given time is updated to "2020-10-16T00:00:00Z"
    And the price monitoring updated every "4" seconds named "my-price-monitoring":
      | horizon | probability | auction extension |
      | 5       | 0.95        | 6                 |
      | 10      | 0.99        | 8                 |
    And the log normal risk model named "my-log-normal-risk-model":
      | risk aversion | tau                    | mu | r     | sigma |
      | 0.000001      | 0.00011407711613050422 | 0  | 0.016 | 2.0   |
    And the markets:
      | id        | quote name | asset | maturity date        | risk model               | margin calculator         | auction duration | fees         | price monitoring    | oracle config          |

    And the following network parameters are set:
      | name                           | value |
      | market.auction.minimumDuration | 6     |
    And the trading mode should be "TRADING_MODE_OPENING_AUCTION" for the market "ETH/DEC20"

  Scenario: Scenario for the system test with opening auction
    Given the traders deposit on asset's general account the following amount:
      | trader  | asset | amount       |
      | trader1 | ETH   | 100000000000 |
      | trader2 | ETH   | 100000000000 |

      | aux     | ETH   | 100000000000 |
      
     # place auxiliary orders so we always have best bid and best offer as to not trigger the liquidity auction
    When the traders place the following orders:
      | trader | market id | side | volume | price  | resulting trades | type       | tif     |
