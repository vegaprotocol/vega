      | market.stake.target.scalingFactor             | 1     |
      | market.liquidity.targetstake.triggering.ratio | 0.9   |
    And the average block duration is "1"
    And the simple risk model named "simple-risk-model-1":
      | long | short | max move up | min move down | probability of trading |
      | 0.1  | 0.1   | 10          | 10            | 0.1                    |

      | maker fee | infrastructure fee |
      | 0.004     | 0.001              |
    And the price monitoring updated every "1" seconds named "price-monitoring-1":
      | horizon | probability | auction extension |
      | 1       | 0.99        | 300               |
    And the markets:
      | id        | quote name | asset | risk model          | margin calculator         | auction duration | fees          | price monitoring   | oracle config          |
