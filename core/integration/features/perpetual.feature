Feature: Simple test creating a perpetual market.

  Background:
    Given the following assets are registered:
      | id  | decimal places |
      | ETH | 18             |
      | USD | 0              |
    And the perpetual oracles from "0xCAFECAFE1":
      | name        | asset | settlement property | settlement type | schedule property | schedule type  | margin funding factor | interest rate | clamp lower bound | clamp upper bound | quote name | settlement decimals |
      | perp-oracle | ETH   | perp.ETH.value      | TYPE_INTEGER    | perp.funding.cue  | TYPE_TIMESTAMP | 1                     | 0             | 0                 | 0                 | ETH        | 5                   |
    And the liquidity sla params named "SLA":
      | price range | commitment min time fraction | performance hysteresis epochs | sla competition factor |
      | 1.0         | 0.5                          | 1                             | 1.0                    |
    And the liquidity monitoring parameters:
      | name               | triggering ratio | time window | scaling factor |
      | lqm-params         | 0.01             | 10s         | 5              |  

    And the markets:
      | id        | quote name | asset | liquidity monitoring | risk model            | margin calculator         | auction duration | fees         | price monitoring | data source config | linear slippage factor | quadratic slippage factor | decimal places | position decimal places | market type | sla params |

    # All parties have 1,000,000.000,000,000,000,000,000
    # Add as many parties as needed here
