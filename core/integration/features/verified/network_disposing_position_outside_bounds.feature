Feature: Disposing position outside bounds

  # A network should be able to dispose it's position against any orders outside price monitoring bounds but not orders outside the liquidity price range.

  Background:

    # Configure the network
    Given the average block duration is "1"
    And the following network parameters are set:
      | name                                    | value |
      | network.markPriceUpdateMaximumFrequency | 0s    |
      | limits.markets.maxPeggedOrders          | 2     |
    And the following assets are registered:
      | id      | decimal places | quantum |
      | USD.0.1 | 0              | 1       |

    # Configure the markets
    Given the liquidation strategies:
      | name                | disposal step | disposal fraction | full disposal size | max fraction consumed |
      | liquidation-strat-1 | 1             | 0.5               | 0                  | 1                     |

    And the price monitoring named "price-monitoring":
      | horizon | probability | auction extension |
      | 6200    | 0.99        | 5                 |
    And the markets:
      | id        | quote name | asset    | risk model                    | margin calculator         | auction duration | fees         | price monitoring | data source config     | linear slippage factor | quadratic slippage factor | liquidation strategy | sla params    |

  Scenario: Network considers volume outside price-monitoring bounds as avaliable to dispose against when calculating max consumption (0012-POSR-019)(0012-POSR-020)(0012-POSR-025)(0012-POSR-029)
    # Orderbook setup such that LPs post orders outside of price-monitoring bounds using limit ormal orders and iceberg orders. The avaliable volume should include volume outside bounds and the full size of the iceberg orders.

    Given the liquidity sla params named "sla-params":
      | price range | commitment min time fraction | performance hysteresis epochs | sla competition factor |
      | 100         | 0.6                          | 1                             | 1.0                    |
    When the markets are updated:
      | id        | linear slippage factor | quadratic slippage factor | sla params |
      | ETH/MAR23 | 1e-3                   | 0                         | sla-params |

    # Setup the market
    Given the initial insurance pool balance is "10000" for all the markets
