## Integration test framework for AMM

### Creating, amending and submitting AMMs

To create a new AMM submission:

```
When the parties submit the following AMM:
  | party    | market id | amount            | slippage           | base | lower bound    | upper bound    | lower margin ratio                   | upper margin ratio                   | error                                  |
  | party id | market ID | commitment amount | tolerance as float | uint | min price uint | max price uint | margin ratio at lower bound as float | margin ratio at upper bound as float | OPTIONAL: error expected on submission |
```

All fields, except for `error` are required here.

Once an AMM has been created, we may want to amend it, so to amend an existing AMM:

```
Then the parties ammend the following AMM:
  | party               | market id            | amount         | slippage         | base     | lower bound | upper bound | lower margin ratio | upper margin ratio | error    |
  | party id (REQUIRED) | market ID (REQUIRED) | optional: uint | float (REQUIRED) | optional | optional    | optional    | optional           | optional           | optional |
```

The only 3 fields that are required are `party`, `market id`, and `slippage`. Any other fields omitted will not be updated.

Lastly, cancelling an existing AMM can be done through:

```
And the parties cancel the following AMM:
  | party    | market id | method              | error                    |
  | party id | market ID | cancellation method | OPTIONAL: error expected |
```

The possible values for `method` are `METHOD_IMMEDIATE` or `METHOD_REDUCE_ONLY`. Technically `METHOD_UNSPECIFIED` is also a valid value for `method`, but doesn't apply for integration tests.

### Checking AMM pools

To see what's going on with an existing AMM, we can check the AMM pool events with the following steps:

```
Then the AMM pool status should be:
  | party    | market id | amount           | status          | reason                      | base | lower bound | upper bound | lower margin ratio | upper margin ratio |
  | party ID | market ID | commitment amout | AMM pool status | OPTIONAL: AMM status reason | uint | uint        | uint        | float              | float              |
```

Required fields are `party`, `market id`, `amount`, and `status`. All others are optional. possible values for AMM pool status are:

```
STATUS_UNSPECIFIED (not applicable)
STATUS_ACTIVE
STATUS_REJECTED
STATUS_CANCELLED
STATUS_STOPPED
STATUS_REDUCE_ONLY
```

The possible `AMM status reason` values are:

```
STATUS_REASON_UNSPECIFIED
STATUS_REASON_CANCELLED_BY_PARTY
STATUS_REASON_CANNOT_FILL_COMMITMENT
STATUS_REASON_PARTY_ALREADY_OWNS_A_POOL
STATUS_REASON_PARTY_CLOSED_OUT
STATUS_REASON_MARKET_CLOSED
STATUS_REASON_COMMITMENT_TOO_LOW
STATUS_REASON_CANNOT_REBASE
```

Checking the status for a given AMM only checks the most recent AMMPool event that was emitted. If we need to check all statuses a given AMM passed through during a scenario, use the following step:

```
And the following AMM pool events should be emitted:
  | party    | market id | amount           | status          | reason                      | base | lower bound | upper bound | lower margin ratio | upper margin ratio |
  | party ID | market ID | commitment amout | AMM pool status | OPTIONAL: AMM status reason | uint | uint        | uint        | float              | float              |
```

The table data is identical to that used in the previous step, with the same optional/required fields. The difference here is that we can check whether the correct events were emitted in a scenario like this:

```
When 
When the parties submit the following AMM:
  | party  | market id | amount | slippage | base | lower bound | upper bound | lower margin ratio | upper margin ratio |
  | party1 | ETH/DEC24 | 10000  | 0.1      | 1000 | 900         | 1100        | 0.2                | 0.15               |
Then the parties amend the following AMM:
  | party  | market id | amount | slippage | base | lower bound | upper bound | upper margin ratio |
  | party1 | ETH/DEC24 | 20000  | 0.15     | 1010 | 910         | 1110        | 0.2                |
# simple status check, only 1 event can be checked, checking for the initial submission will fail
And the AMM pool status should be:
  | party  | market id | amount | status        | base | lower bound | upper bound | lower margin ratio | upper margin ratio |
  | party1 | ETH/DEC24 | 20000  | STATUS_ACTIVE | 1010 | 910         | 1110        | 0.2                | 0.2                |
When the parties cancel the following AMM:
  | party  | market id | method           |
  | party1 | ETH/DEC24 | METHOD_IMMEDIATE |
# check all events emitted so far
Then the following AMM pool events should be emitted:
  | party  | market id | amount | status           | base | lower bound | upper bound | lower margin ratio | upper margin ratio | reason                           |
  | party1 | ETH/DEC24 | 10000  | STATUS_ACTIVE    | 1000 | 900         | 1100        | 0.2                | 0.15               |                                  |
  | party1 | ETH/DEC24 | 20000  | STATUS_ACTIVE    | 1010 | 910         | 1110        | 0.2                | 0.2                |                                  |
  | party1 | ETH/DEC24 | 20000  | STATUS_CANCELLED | 1010 | 910         | 1110        | 0.2                | 0.2                | STATUS_REASON_CANCELLED_BY_PARTY |
```

### Checking AMM account balances and transfers

The AMM pool and sub-accounts are assigned derrived ID's, which can't be specified from the integration test scenario. To allow verifying the balances of the accounts, and check whether or not the expected transfers to and from said account happened, it's possible to assign aliases to the derived ID's.

```
Then set the following AMM sub account aliases:
  | party    | market id | alias               |
  | party ID | market ID | account owner alias |
```

This step _must_ be used _after_ the AMM submission has been made (ie after we've created the AMM pool), otherwise it will fail.

Once an alias has been created, we can check the balance of the AMM pool account using the following step:

```
Then parties have the following AMM account balances:
  | account alias     | asset | balance          |
  | alias set earlier | asset | expected balance |
```

The alias set in the first step is mapped to the internally derived ID, and the balance will be checked in the normal way (getting the most recent account balance event, compare the balance to the expected amount).

Checking transfers is done through the existing step, but a new optional field was added:

```
Then the following transfers should happen:
  | from       | from account      | to       | to account      | market id | amount | asset | type                    | is amm         |
  | from owner | from account type | to owner | to account type | market ID | amount | asset | OPTIONAL: transfer type | OPTIONAL: bool |
```

The new field `is amm` should be `true` for transfers involving AMM sub-accounts. An AMM sub-account is defined as being a general account, does not have a market, and the owner is a pre-defined alias (as per above). For example, a transfer from a general account to an AMM pool sub-account would look something like this:

```
When the parties submit the following AMM:
  | party  | market id | amount | slippage | base | lower bound | upper bound | lower margin ratio | upper margin ratio |
  | party1 | ETH/DEC24 | 10000  | 0.1      | 1000 | 900         | 1100        | 0.2                | 0.15               |
Then set the the following AMM sub account aliases:
  | party  | market id | alias          |
  | party1 | ETH/DEC24 | party1-amm-acc |
And the following transfers should happen:
  | from   | from account         | to             | to account           | market id | amount | asset | is amm |
  | party1 | ACCOUNT_TYPE_GENERAL | party1-amm-acc | ACCOUNT_TYPE_GENERAL |           | 10000  | ETH   | true   |
```

It's important to note that a vAMM will be receiving fees from particular markets, and when holding a position, will create a margin account on the given market, transfers for this can be checked using the same alias like so:

```
And the following transfers should happen:
  | from     | from account            | to       | to account              | market id | amount | asset | is amm | type                            |
  |          | ACCOUNT_TYPE_FEES_MAKER | vamm1-id | ACCOUNT_TYPE_GENERAL    | ETH/MAR22 | 1      | USD   | true   | TRANSFER_TYPE_MAKER_FEE_RECEIVE |
  |          | ACCOUNT_TYPE_FEES_MAKER | vamm1-id | ACCOUNT_TYPE_GENERAL    | ETH/MAR22 | 2      | USD   | true   | TRANSFER_TYPE_MAKER_FEE_RECEIVE |
  | vamm1-id | ACCOUNT_TYPE_GENERAL    |          | ACCOUNT_TYPE_SETTLEMENT | ETH/MAR22 | 88     | USD   | true   | TRANSFER_TYPE_MTM_LOSS          |
  | vamm1-id | ACCOUNT_TYPE_GENERAL    | vamm1-id | ACCOUNT_TYPE_MARGIN     | ETH/MAR22 | 274    | USD   | true   | TRANSFER_TYPE_MARGIN_LOW        |
```

### Checking AMM trades

Because the parties who created the vAMM don't actually trade directly, the derived party ID will appear as the buyer or seller. The account owner alias created above should therefore be used to check the buyer/seller of trades involving the vAMM pools:

```
Then the following trades should be executed:
  | buyer  | price | size | seller      | is amm |
  | party5 | 106   | 1    | vamm1-alias | true   |
  | party5 | 110   | 1    | party2      |        |
  | party5 | 128   | 2    | vamm1-alias | true   |
  | party5 | 140   | 1    | party4      |        |
```

This step has added the `is amm` column (optional) which should be set to `true` to lookup the actual party ID using the vAMM alias created in the step outlined above.

### Checking vAMM position

Like any party, we may want to check the overall position of a vAMM pool. To do this, we can use the existing step to check the profit and loss. Like with the trade-check and transfer checks, a boolean column `is amm` was added to instruct the integration test framewokr to interpret the party ID given as being a vAMM alias.

```
Then the parties should have the following profit and loss:
  | party    | volume | unrealised pnl | realised pnl | is amm |
  | party5   | 5      | 88             | 0            |        |
  | party1   | 1      | 40             | 0            |        |
  | party2   | -2     | -70            | 0            |        |
  | party4   | -1     | 0              | 0            |        |
  | vamm1-id | -3     | -58            | 0            | true   |
```

### DEBUG STEPS

The debug steps specific to AMMs are simply ways of printing out the AMM pool event data in human-readable form:

```
# simply dump all AMM pool events
debug all AMM pool events
# debug all AMM pool events for a given party
debug AMM pool events for party "([^"]+)"
# debug all AMM pool events for a given market
debug all AMM pool events for market "([^"]+)"
# debug all AMM pool events for a given market and party
debug all AMM pool events for market "([^"]+)" and party "([^"]+)"
```
