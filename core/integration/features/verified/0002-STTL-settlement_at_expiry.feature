      | party  | volume | unrealised pnl | realised pnl |
      | party1 | -1     | 0              | 0            |
      | party2 | 1      | 0              | 0            |

    And then the network moves ahead "10" blocks

    When the oracles broadcast data signed with "0xCAFECAFE1":
      | name             | value |
      | prices.ETH.value | 800   |

    And then the network moves ahead "10" blocks

    # Check that party positions and overall account balances are the same as before auction start (accounting for a settlement transfer of 200 from party2 to party1)
    Then the parties should have the following profit and loss:
      | party  | volume | unrealised pnl | realised pnl |
      | party1 | -1     | 0              | 200          |
      | party2 | 1      | 0              | -200         |

    And the parties should have the following account balances:
      | party  | asset | market id | margin | general |
      | party1 | ETH   | ETH/DEC21 | 0      | 10205   |
      | party2 | ETH   | ETH/DEC21 | 0      | 775     |

    And the cumulated balance for all accounts should be worth "102012000"
    And the insurance pool balance should be "0" for the market "ETH/DEC21"
    And the global insurance pool balance should be "500" for the asset "ETH"
    And the insurance pool balance should be "500" for the market "ETH/DEC19"
