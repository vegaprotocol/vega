# Changelog

## 0.22.0

*2020-07-20*

This release primarily focuses on setting up Vega nodes to deal correctly with events sourced from other chains, working towards bridging assets from Ethereum. This includes responding to asset events from Ethereum, and support for validator nodes notarising asset movements and proposals.

It also contains a lot of bug fixes and improvements, primarily around an internal refactor to using an event bus to communicate between packages. Also included are some corrections for order statuses that were incorrectly being reported or left outdated on the APIs.
