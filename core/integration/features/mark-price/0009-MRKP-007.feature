    # AC 0009-MRKP-007 when network.markPriceUpdateMaximumFrequency>0s
    When the network moves ahead "2" blocks
    Then the mark price should be "15900" for the market "ETH/FEB23"

    And the parties should have the following margin levels:
      | party | market id | maintenance | margin mode  |
      | party | ETH/FEB23 | 21465       | cross margin |
    #margin = 3*15900*(0.25)+3*0.1*15900 + 3*0.1*15900=21465

    Then the parties should have the following account balances:
      | party | asset | market id | margin | general |
      | party | USD   | ETH/FEB23 | 25758  | 22292   |

    And the parties place the following orders:
      | party           | market id | side | volume | price | resulting trades | type       | tif     | reference |
      | buySideProvider | ETH/FEB23 | buy  | 2      | 15902 | 1                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |           |

    When the network moves ahead "2" blocks
    Then the mark price should be "15900" for the market "ETH/FEB23"
    When the network moves ahead "3" blocks
    Then the mark price should be "15902" for the market "ETH/FEB23"

    And the parties place the following orders:
      | party           | market id | side | volume | price | resulting trades | type       | tif     | reference |
      | buySideProvider | ETH/FEB23 | buy  | 1      | 15904 | 1                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |           |

    When the network moves ahead "2" blocks
    Then the mark price should be "15902" for the market "ETH/FEB23"
    When the network moves ahead "3" blocks
    Then the mark price should be "15904" for the market "ETH/FEB23"
