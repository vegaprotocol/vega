# Validators

This package manages the mapping of Tendermint nodes to Vega nodes. This is important as it determines which nodes need to be involved in a multisig transacton (e.g. when a user wants to withdraw collateral)

To read more about the multisig functionality, see the [nodewallet](../nodewallet/) folder.
