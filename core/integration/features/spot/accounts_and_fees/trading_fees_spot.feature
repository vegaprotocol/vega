      | horizon | probability | auction extension |
      | 360000  | 0.999       | 1                 |

    And the spot markets:
      | id      | name    | base asset | quote asset | risk model             | auction duration | fees          | price monitoring   | decimal places | position decimal places | sla params    |

    # place orders and generate trades
    And the parties place the following orders:
      | party  | market id | side | volume | price | resulting trades | type       | tif     | reference       |

    #During opening auction, holding asset is transfered from general account to holding account: 0080-SP-AUC-001
    Then "party1" should have holding account balance of "4000" for asset "ETH"
    Then "party1" should have general account balance of "6000" for asset "ETH"
    Then "party2" should have holding account balance of "200" for asset "BTC"

    And the parties amend the following orders:
      | party  | reference    | price | size delta | tif     |
      | party2 | party-order2 | 1000  | 0          | TIF_GTC |

    And the opening auction period ends for market "BTC/ETH"
    And the market data for the market "BTC/ETH" should be:
      | mark price | trading mode            | horizon | min bound | max bound |
      | 1500       | TRADING_MODE_CONTINUOUS | 360000  | 976       | 2268      |

    And the following trades should be executed:
      | buyer  | price | size | seller |
      | party1 | 1500  | 100  | party2 |
    Then the network moves ahead "10" blocks

    Then "party1" should have holding account balance of "2000" for asset "ETH"
    Then "party1" should have general account balance of "6500" for asset "ETH"
    Then "party1" should have general account balance of "100" for asset "BTC"

    Then "party2" should have holding account balance of "100" for asset "BTC"
    #party2 sold 1BTC for 15ETH to party1
    Then "party2" should have general account balance of "300" for asset "BTC"
    Then "party2" should have general account balance of "1500" for asset "ETH"

    Then the order book should have the following volumes for market "BTC/ETH":

      | 1500       | TRADING_MODE_CONTINUOUS | AUCTION_TRIGGER_UNSPECIFIED |

    Then the following transfers should happen:
      | from   | to     | from account            | to account                       | market id | amount | asset |
      | party1 | party2 | ACCOUNT_TYPE_GENERAL    | ACCOUNT_TYPE_GENERAL             | BTC/ETH   | 1000   | ETH   |

    Then "party1" should have general account balance of "200" for asset "BTC"

    Then "party2" should have holding account balance of "0" for asset "BTC"
    Then "party2" should have general account balance of "300" for asset "BTC"
    #party2 sold 1 BTC for 10ETH, and should have 10+15=25ETH now, party2 is the price taker, so party2 subtracted 0.04*10 =0.4 from general account for the taker fee, so party2 recieved 24.6ETH
    Then "party2" should have general account balance of "2460" for asset "ETH"

    When the network moves ahead "2" blocks

    Then the order book should have the following volumes for market "BTC/ETH":
      | side | price | volume |
      | buy  | 1000  | 100    |
    #If the party does not have sufficient funds in their `general` account to cover this transfer, the order should be cancelled: 0080-SP-AUC-002; 0080-SP-AUC-003

    Then "party3" should have holding account balance of "0" for asset "ETH"
    Then "party3" should have general account balance of "8020" for asset "ETH"
    Then "party3" should have general account balance of "100" for asset "BTC"

    #the maker fee + infra fee = 0.04*(1*20)=0.8, party4 will receive 20ETH and with fee 0.8ETH substracted, so party4 recived 19.2ETH
    Then "party4" should have holding account balance of "100" for asset "BTC"
    Then "party4" should have general account balance of "1920" for asset "ETH"
    Then "party4" should have general account balance of "300" for asset "BTC"

    #If the order is cancelled or the size is reduced through an order amendment, funds should be released from the `holding_account` and returned to the `general_account`:0080-SP-FEES-008

    Then "party3" should have holding account balance of "2335" for asset "ETH"
    Then "party4" should have holding account balance of "200" for asset "BTC"

    When the network moves ahead "2" blocks
    #past the price monitoring auction extension, so trade happened, holding account for party3 is release after trading: 0080-SP-AUC-004
    Then the market data for the market "BTC/ETH" should be:
