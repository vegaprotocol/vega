    Given the average block duration is "2"
  @Now @SLABond @Liquidation
  Scenario: 001: All liquidity providers in the market receive a greater than zero amount of liquidity fee
    Given the parties deposit on asset's general account the following amount:
      | party  | asset | amount |
      | lp1    | USD   | 159000 |
      | lp2    | USD   | 100000 |

      | lp_2 | lp2   | ETH/MAR22 | 1000              | 0.001 | submission |

    When the network moves ahead "2" blocks
    And the parties place the following pegged iceberg orders:
      | party | market id | peak size | minimum visible size | side | pegged reference | volume | offset |
      | lp1   | ETH/MAR22 | 5         | 1                    | buy  | BID              | 5      | 20     |
