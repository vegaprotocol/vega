Feature: check pegged GTT and GTC in auction

  Background:

    Given the log normal risk model named "log-normal-risk-model-1":
      | risk aversion | tau | mu | r | sigma |
      | 0.000001      | 0.1 | 0  | 0 | 1.0   |
    #risk factor short = 3.55690359157934000
    #risk factor long = 0.801225765
    And the margin calculator named "margin-calculator-0":
      | search factor | initial factor | release factor |
      | 1.2           | 1.5            | 2              |
    And the price monitoring named "price-monitoring-1":
      | horizon | probability | auction extension |
      | 36600   | 0.99        | 300               |
    And the following network parameters are set:
      | name                              | value |
      | market.auction.minimumDuration    | 1     |

      | limits.markets.maxPeggedOrders    | 1500  |
      | limits.markets.maxPeggedOrders    | 4     |
    And the markets:

  Scenario: 001, Pegged GTC (good till time) (parked in auction), Pegged orders will be [parked] if placed during [an auction], with time priority preserved. 0011-MARA-017
    Given the parties deposit on asset's general account the following amount:

      | aux2             | ETH   | 100000000 |

    # submit our LP
    Then the parties submit the following liquidity provision:
      | id  | party  | market id | commitment amount | fee | lp type    |
      | lp1 | party1 | ETH/DEC19 | 3000              | 0.1 | submission |
      | lp1 | party1 | ETH/DEC19 | 3000              | 0.1 | submission |
    And the parties place the following pegged iceberg orders:
      | party  | market id | peak size | minimum visible size | side | pegged reference | volume     | offset |
      | party1 | ETH/DEC19 | 2         | 1                    | buy  | BID              | 50         | 10     |

    # get out of auction
    When the parties place the following orders:

    Then the opening auction period ends for market "ETH/DEC19"
    And the trading mode should be "TRADING_MODE_CONTINUOUS" for the market "ETH/DEC19"

    And the market data for the market "ETH/DEC19" should be:
