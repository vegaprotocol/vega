      | 1000       | TRADING_MODE_CONTINUOUS         | AUCTION_TRIGGER_UNSPECIFIED | 1003              | 30      | 1003      | 1000      | 1006      | 

  Scenario: Verify that trigger update in continuous trading works as expected

    When the network moves ahead "2" blocks
    Then the market data for the market "ETH/FEB23" should be:
      | mark price | trading mode            | horizon | ref price | min bound | max bound |

      | horizon | probability | auction extension |
      | 30      | 0.95        | 1                 |
    
    # update trigger here so that there's only one
    When the markets are updated:
      | id        | price monitoring       | price type | source weights | source staleness tolerance |
      | ETH/FEB23 | my-price-monitoring-2  | weight     | 0,0,1,0        | 0s,0s,0h0m120s,0s          |

    # the last second of the original extensions
    And the network moves ahead "3" blocks
    Then the market data for the market "ETH/FEB23" should be:
      | mark price | trading mode            | horizon | ref price | min bound | max bound |
