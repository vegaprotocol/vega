Feature: Test mark to market settlement

  Background:

    And the markets:
      | id        | quote name | asset | risk model                  | margin calculator         | auction duration | fees         | price monitoring | oracle config          |
      | ETH/DEC19 | ETH        | ETH   | default-simple-risk-model-3 | default-margin-calculator | 1                | default-none | default-none     | default-eth-for-future |
    And the following network parameters are set:
      | name                           | value |
      | market.auction.minimumDuration | 1     |

  Scenario: If settlement amount <= the trader’s margin account balance entire settlement amount is transferred from trader’s margin account to the market’s temporary settlement account
    Given the traders deposit on asset's general account the following amount:
      | trader  | asset | amount |
      | trader1 | ETH   | 10000  |
      | trader2 | ETH   | 10000  |
      | trader3 | ETH   | 10000  |
      | aux     | ETH   | 100000 |
      | aux2    | ETH   | 100000 |

     # place auxiliary orders so we always have best bid and best offer as to not trigger the liquidity auction
    When the traders place the following orders:
      | trader | market id | side | volume | price | resulting trades | type       | tif     |
      | aux    | ETH/DEC19 | buy  | 1      | 49    | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |
      | aux    | ETH/DEC19 | sell | 1      | 5001  | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |

      | aux    | ETH/DEC19 | sell | 1      | 1000  | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |

    Then the opening auction period ends for market "ETH/DEC19"
    And the trading mode should be "TRADING_MODE_CONTINUOUS" for the market "ETH/DEC19"
    And the settlement account should have a balance of "0" for the market "ETH/DEC19"

    When the traders place the following orders:
      | trader  | market id | side | volume | price | resulting trades | type       | tif     |
      | trader1 | ETH/DEC19 | sell | 1      | 1000  | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |
      | trader2 | ETH/DEC19 | buy  | 1      | 1000  | 1                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |
    Then the traders should have the following account balances:
      | trader  | asset | market id | margin | general |
      | trader1 | ETH   | ETH/DEC19 | 4921   | 5079    |
      | trader2 | ETH   | ETH/DEC19 | 1273   | 8727    |

    And the settlement account should have a balance of "0" for the market "ETH/DEC19"
    When the traders place the following orders:
      | trader  | market id | side | volume | price | resulting trades | type       | tif     |
      | trader1 | ETH/DEC19 | sell | 1      | 2000  | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |
    Then the traders should have the following account balances:
      | trader  | asset | market id | margin | general |
      | trader1 | ETH   | ETH/DEC19 | 5041   | 4959    |

      | trader2 | ETH   | ETH/DEC19 | 2605   | 8395    |

    Then the following transfers should happen:
      | from    | to     | from account        | to account              | market id | amount | asset |
      | trader1 | market | ACCOUNT_TYPE_MARGIN | ACCOUNT_TYPE_SETTLEMENT | ETH/DEC19 | 1000   | ETH   |
    And the cumulated balance for all accounts should be worth "230000"
    And the settlement account should have a balance of "0" for the market "ETH/DEC19"

  Scenario: If settlement amount > trader’s margin account balance  and <= trader's margin account balance + general account balance for the asset, he full balance of the trader’s margin account is transferred to the market’s temporary settlement account the remainder, i.e. difference between the amount transferred from the margin account and the settlement amount, is transferred from the trader’s general account for the asset to the market’s temporary settlement account
    Given the traders deposit on asset's general account the following amount:
      | trader  | asset | amount |
      | trader1 | ETH   | 10000  |
