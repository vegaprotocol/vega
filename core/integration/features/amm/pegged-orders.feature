    # Setting up the accounts and vAMM submission now is part of the background, because we'll be running scenarios 0090-VAMM-006 through 0090-VAMM-014 on this setup
    Given the parties deposit on asset's general account the following amount:
      | party  | asset | amount  |
      | lp1    | USD   | 1000000 |
      | lp2    | USD   | 1000000 |
      | lp3    | USD   | 1000000 |
      | party1 | USD   | 1000000 |
      | party2 | USD   | 1000000 |
      | party3 | USD   | 1000000 |
      | party4 | USD   | 1000000 |
      | party5 | USD   | 1000000 |
      | vamm1  | USD   | 1000000 |

    When the parties submit the following liquidity provision:
      | id   | party | market id | commitment amount | fee   | lp type    |
      | lp_1 | lp1   | ETH/MAR22 | 600               | 0.02  | submission |
      | lp_2 | lp2   | ETH/MAR22 | 400               | 0.015 | submission |
    Then the network moves ahead "4" blocks
    And the current epoch is "0"

    And the parties place the following orders:
      | party  | market id | side | volume | price | resulting trades | type       | tif     | reference |
      | lp1    | ETH/MAR22 | buy  | 20     | 40    | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | LP1BO     |

    When the opening auction period ends for market "ETH/MAR22"
    Then the following trades should be executed:
      | buyer  | price | size | seller |
      | party1 | 100   | 1    | party2 |

    And the market data for the market "ETH/MAR22" should be:
      | mark price | trading mode            | target stake | supplied stake | open interest | ref price | mid price | static mid price |
      | 100        | TRADING_MODE_CONTINUOUS | 39           | 1000           | 1             | 100       | 100       | 100              |
    When the parties submit the following AMM:
      | party | market id | amount | slippage | base | lower bound | upper bound | lower leverage | upper leverage | proposed fee |
      | vamm1 | ETH/MAR22 | 100000 | 0.1      | 100  | 85          | 150         | 4              | 4              | 0.01         |
    Then the AMM pool status should be:
      | party | market id | amount | status        | base | lower bound | upper bound | lower leverage | upper leverage |
      | vamm1 | ETH/MAR22 | 100000 | STATUS_ACTIVE | 100  | 85          | 150         | 4              | 4              |

    And set the following AMM sub account aliases:
      | party | market id | alias    |
      | vamm1 | ETH/MAR22 | vamm1-id |
    And the following transfers should happen:
      | from  | from account         | to       | to account           | market id | amount | asset | is amm | type                  |

  @VAMM
  Scenario: Simply submit pegged orders, cancel all orders on the orderbook, the pegged orders should be pegged to the AMM orders.
    When the parties place the following pegged iceberg orders:
      | party | market id | side | volume | peak size | minimum visible size | pegged reference | offset |
      | lp1   | ETH/MAR22 | buy  | 100    | 10        | 2                    | BID              | 5      |
      | lp1   | ETH/MAR22 | sell | 100    | 10        | 2                    | ASK              | 5      |
    Then the order book should have the following volumes for market "ETH/MAR22":
      | side | price | volume |
      | buy  | 40    | 20     |
      | buy  | 94    | 10     |
      | sell | 106   | 10     |
      | sell | 160   | 10     |

    # ensure moving the network by 1 block doesn't change a thing
    When the network moves ahead "1" blocks
    Then the order book should have the following volumes for market "ETH/MAR22":
      | side | price | volume |
      | buy  | 40    | 20     |
      | buy  | 94    | 10     |
      | sell | 106   | 10     |
      | sell | 160   | 10     |

    # Now cancel the LP1BO and LP1SO orders, the pegged orders should remain where they are.
    When the parties cancel the following orders:
      | party | reference |
      | lp1   | LP1BO     |
      | lp1   | LP1SO     |
    Then the order book should have the following volumes for market "ETH/MAR22":
      | side | price | volume |
      | buy  | 40    | 0      |
      | buy  | 94    | 10     |
      | sell | 106   | 10     |
      | sell | 160   | 0      |

    # We pass through block end CheckBook call without problems, and the book volumes still check out.
    When the network moves ahead "1" blocks
    Then the order book should have the following volumes for market "ETH/MAR22":
      | side | price | volume |
      | buy  | 40    | 0      |
      | buy  | 94    | 10     |
      | sell | 106   | 10     |
