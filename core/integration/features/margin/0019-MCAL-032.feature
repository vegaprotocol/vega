Feature: Test magin under isolated margin mode
  Background:
    # Set liquidity parameters to allow "zero" target-stake which is needed to construct the order-book defined in the ACs
    Given the following network parameters are set:
      | name                                    | value |
      | network.markPriceUpdateMaximumFrequency | 0s    |
    And the liquidity monitoring parameters:
      | name       | triggering ratio | time window | scaling factor |
      | lqm-params | 0.00             | 24h         | 1e-9           |
