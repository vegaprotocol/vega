    # Setting up the accounts and vAMM submission now is part of the background, because we'll be running scenarios 0090-VAMM-006 through 0090-VAMM-014 on this setup
    Given the parties deposit on asset's general account the following amount:
      | party  | asset | amount  |
      | lp1    | USD   | 1000000 |

      | party5 | USD   | 1000000 |
      | vamm1  | USD   | 30000   |

    When the parties submit the following liquidity provision:
      | id   | party | market id | commitment amount | fee   | lp type    |

      | lp_2 | lp2   | ETH/MAR22 | 400               | 0.015 | submission |
    Then the network moves ahead "4" blocks
    And the current epoch is "0"

    And the parties place the following orders:
      | party  | market id | side | volume | price | resulting trades | type       | tif     | reference |

    And set the following AMM sub account aliases:
      | party | market id | alias    |
      | vamm1 | ETH/MAR22 | vamm1-id |
    And the following transfers should happen:

  @VAMM
  Scenario: 0090-VAMM-025: If the vAMM is then amended such that it has a new base price of 140 it should attempt to place a trade to rebalance it's position to 0 at a mid price of 140. If that trade can execute with the slippage as configured in the request then the transaction is accepted.
