    # Setting up the accounts and vAMM submission now is part of the background, because we'll be running scenarios 0087-VAMM-006 through 0087-VAMM-014 on this setup
    Given the parties deposit on asset's general account the following amount:
      | party  | asset | amount  |
      | lp1    | USD   | 1000000 |
      | lp2    | USD   | 1000000 |
      | lp3    | USD   | 1000000 |
      | party1 | USD   | 1000000 |
      | party2 | USD   | 1000000 |
      | party3 | USD   | 1000000 |
      | party4 | USD   | 1000000 |
      | party5 | USD   | 1000000 |
      | vamm1  | USD   | 10000   |

    When the parties submit the following liquidity provision:
      | id   | party | market id | commitment amount | fee   | lp type    |
      | lp_1 | lp1   | ETH/MAR22 | 600               | 0.02  | submission |
      | lp_2 | lp2   | ETH/MAR22 | 400               | 0.015 | submission |
    Then the network moves ahead "4" blocks
    And the current epoch is "0"

    And the parties place the following orders:
      | party  | market id | side | volume | price | resulting trades | type       | tif     | reference |
      | lp1    | ETH/MAR22 | buy  | 20     | 40    | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | lp1-b     |

      | party2 | ETH/MAR22 | sell | 1      | 100   | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |           |
      | party3 | ETH/MAR22 | sell | 10     | 110   | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |           |
      | lp1    | ETH/MAR22 | sell | 10     | 160   | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | lp1-s     |
    When the opening auction period ends for market "ETH/MAR22"
    Then the following trades should be executed:
      | buyer  | price | size | seller |
      | party1 | 100   | 1    | party2 |

    And the market data for the market "ETH/MAR22" should be:
      | mark price | trading mode            | target stake | supplied stake | open interest | ref price | mid price | static mid price |
      | 100        | TRADING_MODE_CONTINUOUS | 39           | 1000           | 1             | 100       | 100       | 100              |
    When the parties submit the following AMM:
      | party | market id | amount | slippage | base | lower bound | upper bound | lower margin ratio | upper margin ratio |
      | vamm1 | ETH/MAR22 | 1000   | 0.1      | 100  | 85          | 150         | 0.25               | 0.25               |
    Then the AMM pool status should be:
      | party | market id | amount | status        | base | lower bound | upper bound | lower margin ratio | upper margin ratio |
      | vamm1 | ETH/MAR22 | 1000   | STATUS_ACTIVE | 100  | 85          | 150         | 0.25               | 0.25               |

    And set the following AMM sub account aliases:
      | party | market id | alias    |
      | vamm1 | ETH/MAR22 | vamm1-id |
    And the following transfers should happen:
      | from  | from account         | to       | to account           | market id | amount | asset | is amm | type                             |
      | vamm1 | ACCOUNT_TYPE_GENERAL | vamm1-id | ACCOUNT_TYPE_GENERAL |           | 1000   | USD   | true   | TRANSFER_TYPE_AMM_SUBACCOUNT_LOW |

  @VAMM
  Scenario Outline: 0087-VAMM-031: When an AMM is active on a market at time of settlement with a position in a well collateralised state, the market can settle successfully and then all funds on the AMM key are transferred back to the main party's account.
    # this outline covers 3 distinct situations: 1 where the vAMM breaks even (settlement price == market price), one where the vAMM turns a profit (settlement price < market price), and one with a loss (settlement price > market price)
    When the parties place the following orders:
      | party  | market id | side | volume | price | resulting trades | type       | tif     |
      | party4 | ETH/MAR22 | buy  | 1      | 105   | 1                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |
    # see the trades that make the vAMM go short
    Then the following trades should be executed:
      | buyer  | price | size | seller   | is amm |
      | party4 | 106   | 1    | vamm1-id | true   |

    When the network moves ahead "1" blocks
    Then the market data for the market "ETH/MAR22" should be:
      | mark price | trading mode            | mid price | static mid price | supplied stake | target stake |
      | 106        | TRADING_MODE_CONTINUOUS | 100       | 100              | 1000           | 84           |
    And the parties should have the following profit and loss:
      | party    | volume | unrealised pnl | realised pnl | is amm |
      | party4   | 1      | 0              | 0            |        |
      | vamm1-id | -1     | 0              | 0            | true   |
    And the AMM pool status should be:
      | party | market id | amount | status        | base | lower bound | upper bound | lower margin ratio | upper margin ratio |
      | vamm1 | ETH/MAR22 | 1000   | STATUS_ACTIVE | 100  | 85          | 150         | 0.25               | 0.25               |

    # No terminate && settle the market
    When the oracles broadcast data signed with "0xCAFECAFE":
      | name               | value |
      | trading.terminated | true  |
    Then the network moves ahead "1" blocks

    When the oracles broadcast data signed with "0xCAFECAFE":
      | name             | value          |
      | prices.ETH.value | <settle price> |
    Then the market state should be "STATE_SETTLED" for the market "ETH/MAR22"
    And then the network moves ahead "1" blocks

    # verify the that the margin balance is released, and then the correct balance if transferred from the pool account back to the party.
    And the following transfers should happen:
     | from     | from account         | to       | to account           | market id | amount        | asset | is amm | type                                 |
     | vamm1-id | ACCOUNT_TYPE_MARGIN  | vamm1-id | ACCOUNT_TYPE_GENERAL | ETH/MAR22 | <margin>      | USD   | true   | TRANSFER_TYPE_MARGIN_HIGH            |
     | vamm1-id | ACCOUNT_TYPE_GENERAL | vamm1    | ACCOUNT_TYPE_GENERAL |           | <amm balance> | USD   | true   | TRANSFER_TYPE_AMM_SUBACCOUNT_RELEASE |

    Examples:
      | settle price | margin | amm balance |
      | 106          | 70     | 1001        | # settle price = market price: +1 from fees
      | 105          | 71     | 1002        | # settle price < market price: +1 from fees +1 from final settlement
      | 107          | 69     | 1000        | # settle price > market price: +1 from fees, -1 from final settlement
      | 104          | 72     | 1003        | # settle price < market price: +1 from fees +2 from final settlement
      | 108          | 68     | 999         | # settle price > market price: +1 from fees, -2 from final settlement
