# Test volume and margin when LP volume is pushed inside price monitoring bounds
# and the price monitoring bounds happen to be best bid/ask
Feature: Test margin for lp near price monitoring boundaries
  Background:
    Given the following network parameters are set:
      | name                                                | value |
      | market.value.windowLength                           | 1h    |
      | market.stake.target.timeWindow                      | 24h   |
      | market.stake.target.scalingFactor                   | 1     |
      | market.liquidity.targetstake.triggering.ratio       | 0     |
      | market.liquidity.providers.fee.distributionTimeStep | 10m   |

    And the average block duration is "1"

  Scenario: second scenario for volume at near price monitoring bounds with log-normal

    And the log normal risk model named "log-normal-risk-model-1":
      | risk aversion | tau     | mu | r   | sigma  |
      | 0.000001      | 0.00273 | 0  | 0   |  1.2   |
    And the fees configuration named "fees-config-1":
      | maker fee | infrastructure fee |
      | 0.004     | 0.001              |
    And the price monitoring updated every "1" seconds named "price-monitoring-2":
      | horizon | probability  | auction extension |
      | 43200   | 0.982        | 300               |
    And the markets:
      | id         | quote name | asset | risk model              | margin calculator         | auction duration | fees          | price monitoring   | oracle config          | maturity date        |

    And the oracles broadcast data signed with "0xDEADBEEF":
      | name              | value  |
      | prices.ETH2.value | 100000 |
    And the parties deposit on asset's general account the following amount:
      | party  | asset | amount      |
      | lp1     | ETH2  | 10000000000 |
      | party1 | ETH2  |  1000000000 |
      | party2 | ETH2  |  1000000000 |

    Given the parties submit the following liquidity provision:
      | id          | party   | market id  | commitment amount | fee   | side | pegged reference | proportion | offset | lp type |
      | commitment1 | lp1     | ETH2/MAR22 | 3000000           | 0.001 | buy  | BID              | 500        |  100   | submission |
      | commitment1 | lp1     | ETH2/MAR22 | 3000000           | 0.001 | sell | ASK              | 500        |  100   | amendment |
  
    And the parties place the following orders:
      | party  | market id | side  | volume | price  | resulting trades | type       | tif     | reference  |
      | party1 | ETH2/MAR22 | buy  | 1      | 89942  | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | buy-ref-1  |

    When the opening auction period ends for market "ETH2/MAR22"
    Then the auction ends with a traded volume of "10" at a price of "100000"

    And the parties should have the following profit and loss:
      | party           | volume | unrealised pnl | realised pnl |
      | party1          |  10    | 0              | 0            |
      | party2          | -10    | 0              | 0            |

    And the market data for the market "ETH2/MAR22" should be:

      | 100000     | TRADING_MODE_CONTINUOUS | 43200   | 89942     | 110965    | 361190       | 3000000        | 10            |

      | buy  | 89943    | 0      |
      | buy  | 89942    | 68     |


    # # at this point what's left on the book (static) is the buy @ 89942 and sell @ 110965
    # # so the best bid/ask coincides with the price monitoring bounds.
    # # Since the lp1 offset is +/- 100 the lp1 volume "should" go to 89842 and 111065
    # # but because the price monitoring bounds are 89942 and 110965 the volume gets pushed to these
    # # i.e. it's placed at 89942 / 110965.
    # # As these are the best bid / best ask the probability of trading used is 1/2.

    And the parties should have the following margin levels:
      | party    | market id  | maintenance | search   | initial  | release  |
      | lp1       | ETH2/MAR22 | 1986563     | 2185219  | 2383875  | 2781188  |

    And the order book should have the following volumes for market "ETH2/MAR22":

    # # now we place an order which makes the best bid 89943.
    Then the parties place the following orders:
      | party  | market id  | side  | volume | price   | resulting trades   | type       | tif     | reference  |
      | party1 | ETH2/MAR22 | buy   | 1      | 89943   | 0                  | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | buy-ref-4  |

    And the market data for the market "ETH2/MAR22" should be:
      | mark price   | trading mode            | horizon | min bound   | max bound   | target stake   | supplied stake | open interest  |

    # # the lp1 one volume on this side should go to 89843 but because price monitoring bound is still 89942 it gets pushed to 89942.
    # # but 89942 is no longer the best bid, so the risk model is used to get prob of trading. This now given by the log-normal model
    # # Hence a bit volume is required to meet commitment and thus the margin requirement moves but not much.

    # And the order book should have the following volumes for market "ETH2/MAR22":
    #   | side | price    | volume |
    #   | sell | 110965   | 56     |
