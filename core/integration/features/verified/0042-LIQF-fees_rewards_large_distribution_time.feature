Feature: Test liquidity provider reward distribution; Check what happens when distribution period is large (both in genesis)

  Background:

    Given the simple risk model named "simple-risk-model-1":
      | long | short | max move up | min move down | probability of trading |
      | 0.1  | 0.1   | 500         | 500           | 0.1                    |
    And the fees configuration named "fees-config-1":
      | maker fee | infrastructure fee |
      | 0.0004    | 0.001              |
    And the price monitoring named "price-monitoring":
      | horizon | probability | auction extension |
      | 1       | 0.99        | 3                 |
    And the following network parameters are set:
      | name                                                | value |
      | market.value.windowLength                           | 1h    |
      | market.stake.target.timeWindow                      | 24h   |
      | market.stake.target.scalingFactor                   | 1     |
      | market.liquidity.targetstake.triggering.ratio       | 0     |
      | market.liquidity.providers.fee.distributionTimeStep | 720h  |
      | network.markPriceUpdateMaximumFrequency             | 0s    |
    And the markets:
      | id        | quote name | asset | risk model          | margin calculator         | auction duration | fees          | price monitoring | data source config     | linear slippage factor | quadratic slippage factor |
      | ETH/MAR22 | USD        | USD   | simple-risk-model-1 | default-margin-calculator | 2                | fees-config-1 | price-monitoring | default-eth-for-future | 1e6                    | 1e6                       |

    Given the average block duration is "2"

  Scenario: 001: 1 LP joining at start, checking liquidity rewards over 3 periods, 1 period with no trades (0042-LIQF-006)
    # setup accounts
    Given the parties deposit on asset's general account the following amount:
      | party  | asset | amount     |
      | lp1    | USD   | 1000000000 |
      | party1 | USD   | 100000000  |
      | party2 | USD   | 100000000  |

    And the parties submit the following liquidity provision:
      | id  | party | market id | commitment amount | fee   | side | pegged reference | proportion | offset | lp type    |
      | lp1 | lp1   | ETH/MAR22 | 10000             | 0.001 | buy  | BID              | 1          | 2      | submission |
      | lp1 | lp1   | ETH/MAR22 | 10000             | 0.001 | buy  | MID              | 2          | 1      | amendment  |
      | lp1 | lp1   | ETH/MAR22 | 10000             | 0.001 | sell | ASK              | 1          | 2      | amendment  |
      | lp1 | lp1   | ETH/MAR22 | 10000             | 0.001 | sell | MID              | 2          | 1      | amendment  |

    Then the parties place the following orders:
      | party  | market id | side | volume | price | resulting trades | type       | tif     |
      | party1 | ETH/MAR22 | buy  | 1      | 900   | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |
      | party1 | ETH/MAR22 | buy  | 10     | 1000  | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |
      | party2 | ETH/MAR22 | sell | 1      | 1100  | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |
      | party2 | ETH/MAR22 | sell | 10     | 1000  | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |

    Then the opening auction period ends for market "ETH/MAR22"

    And the following trades should be executed:
      | buyer  | price | size | seller |
      | party1 | 1000  | 10   | party2 |

    And the market data for the market "ETH/MAR22" should be:
      | mark price | trading mode            | horizon | min bound | max bound | target stake | supplied stake | open interest |
      | 1000       | TRADING_MODE_CONTINUOUS | 1       | 500       | 1500      | 1000         | 10000          | 10            |
    # target_stake = mark_price x max_oi x target_stake_scaling_factor x rf = 1000 x 10 x 1 x 0.1
    # max_oi: max open interest

    Then the order book should have the following volumes for market "ETH/MAR22":
      | side | price | volume |
      | buy  | 898   | 4      |
      | buy  | 900   | 1      |
      | buy  | 999   | 7      |
      | sell | 1001  | 7      |
      | sell | 1100  | 1      |
      | sell | 1102  | 4      |

    #volume = ceiling(liquidity_obligation x liquidity-normalised-proportion / probability_of_trading / price)
    #for any price better than the bid price or better than the ask price it returns 0.5
    #for any price in within 500 price ticks from the best bid/ask (i.e. worse than) it returns the probability as returned by the risk model (in this case 0.1 scaled by 0.5.
    #priceLvel at 898:10000*(1/3)/898=4
    #priceLvel at 999:10000*(2/3)/999=7
    #priceLvel at 1001:10000*(2/3)/1001=7

      | party2 | USD   | ETH/MAR22 | 1692   | 99998308  |       |

    # party1 margin = 11*1000*0.1 + 10*(1000-968) = 1420
    # party2 margin = 11*1000*0.1 + 10*(1031-1000)= 1410
    Then the parties should have the following margin levels:
      | party  | market id | maintenance | initial |
      | party1 | ETH/MAR22 | 1420        | 1704    |
