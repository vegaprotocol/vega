Feature: Check the margin scaling levels (maintenance, search, initial, release) are correctly applied to the maintenance margin that is calculated by the risk model

  Background:

    Given the log normal risk model named "log-normal-risk-model-1":
      | risk aversion | tau | mu | r | sigma |
      | 0.000001      | 0.1 | 0  | 0 | 1.0   |
    #risk factor short = 3.55690359157934000
    #risk factor long = 0.801225765
    And the margin calculator named "margin-calculator-0":
      | search factor | initial factor | release factor |
      | 1.2           | 1.5            | 2              |
    And the margin calculator named "margin-calculator-1":
