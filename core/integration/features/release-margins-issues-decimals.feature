Feature: Test margin release on order cancel

  Background:

    Given the following assets are registered:
      | id  | decimal places |
      | ETH | 5              |
    And the markets:
      | id        | quote name | asset | risk model                  | margin calculator         | auction duration | fees         | price monitoring | data source config     | decimal places | linear slippage factor | quadratic slippage factor | sla params      |
      | ETH/DEC19 | ETH        | ETH   | default-simple-risk-model-3 | default-margin-calculator | 1                | default-none | default-none     | default-eth-for-future | 2              | 1e6                    | 1e6                       | default-futures |
    And the oracles broadcast data signed with "0xDEADBEEF":
      | name             | value |
      | prices.ETH.value | 42    |
    And the following network parameters are set:
      | name                                    | value |
      | network.markPriceUpdateMaximumFrequency | 0s    |
