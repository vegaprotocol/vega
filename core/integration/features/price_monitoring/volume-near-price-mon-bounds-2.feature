# and the price monitoring bounds happen to be best bid/ask
Feature: Test margin for lp near price monitoring boundaries
  Background:
    Given the following network parameters are set:
      | name                                                | value |

    And the average block duration is "1"

  Scenario: second scenario for volume at near price monitoring bounds with log-normal

    Given the log normal risk model named "log-normal-risk-model-1":

      | maker fee | infrastructure fee |
      | 0.004     | 0.001              |
    And the price monitoring named "price-monitoring-2":
      | horizon | probability | auction extension |
      | 43200   | 0.982       | 300               |
    And the liquidity sla params named "SLA":
      | price range | commitment min time fraction | performance hysteresis epochs | sla competition factor |
      | 1.0         | 0.5                          | 1                             | 1.0                    |
