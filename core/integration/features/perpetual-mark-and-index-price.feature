Feature: Simple tests for perpetual market mark price.

  Background:
    Given the following assets are registered:
      | id  | decimal places |
      | ETH | 5              |
    And the liquidity sla params named "SLA":
      | price range | commitment min time fraction | performance hysteresis epochs | sla competition factor |
      | 1.0         | 0.5                          | 1                             | 1.0                    |
    And the liquidity monitoring parameters:
      | name               | triggering ratio | time window | scaling factor |
      | lqm-params         | 0.01             | 10s         | 5              |  

    And the following network parameters are set:

    # All parties have 1,000,000.000,000,000,000,000,000
    # Add as many parties as needed here
    And the parties deposit on asset's general account the following amount:
      | party   | asset | amount                     |
      | lpprov  | ETH   | 10000000000000000000000000 |
