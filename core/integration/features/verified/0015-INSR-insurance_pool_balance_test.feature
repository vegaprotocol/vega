Scenario: case 1 (using simple risk model) from https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CIPH0aQmIKj6YeFW9ApP_l-jwB4OcsNQ/edit#gid=1555964910 (0015-INSR-001, 0015-INSR-003, 0018-RSKM-001, 0018-RSKM-003, 0010-MARG-004, 0010-MARG-005, 0010-MARG-006, 0010-MARG-007, 0010-MARG-008. 0010-MARG-009)
  Background:

    Given the simple risk model named "simple-risk-model-1":
      | long | short | max move up | min move down | probability of trading |
      | 1    | 2     | 100         | -100          | 0.1                    |

    And the margin calculator named "margin-calculator-1":
      | search factor | initial factor | release factor |
      | 2             | 3              | 5              |

    And the markets:
      | id        | quote name | asset | risk model          | margin calculator   | auction duration | fees         | price monitoring | data source config          |

    And the following network parameters are set:
      | name                                    | value |
      | market.auction.minimumDuration          | 1     |
