Feature: Test pegged order amend under isolated margin mode
    Background:
        Given the following network parameters are set:
            | name                                    | value |

            | limits.markets.maxPeggedOrders          | 6     |
        And the liquidity monitoring parameters:
            | name       | triggering ratio | time window | scaling factor |
            | lqm-params | 0.00             | 24h         | 1e-9           |
        And the simple risk model named "simple-risk-model":
            | long | short | max move up | min move down | probability of trading |
            | 0.1  | 0.1   | 100         | -100          | 0.2                    |
        And the markets:

        And the parties deposit on asset's general account the following amount:
            | party       | asset | amount       |
            | lpprov      | USD   | 100000000000 |

            | test_party2 | USD   | 100000       |

        When the parties place the following orders:
            | party     | market id | side | volume | price | resulting trades | type       | tif     | reference |
            | aux_buys  | ETH/FEB23 | buy  | 10     | 995   | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | ref-1     |

        And the parties submit the following liquidity provision:
            | id  | party  | market id | commitment amount | fee | lp type    |
            | lp1 | lpprov | ETH/FEB23 | 900000            | 0.1 | submission |
            | lp1 | lpprov | ETH/FEB23 | 900000            | 0.1 | submission |

        Then the opening auction period ends for market "ETH/FEB23"
        And the mark price should be "1000" for the market "ETH/FEB23"
        And the trading mode should be "TRADING_MODE_CONTINUOUS" for the market "ETH/FEB23"

            | party      | reference | status           |
            | test_party | sell_peg  | STATUS_CANCELLED |
        And the parties should have the following margin levels:
            | party      | market id | maintenance | search | initial | release | margin mode     | margin factor | order |
            | test_party | ETH/FEB23 | 1050        | 0      | 1260    | 0       | isolated margin | 0.91          | 0     |
        And the parties should have the following account balances:
            | party      | asset | market id | margin | general | order margin |
            | test_party | USD   | ETH/FEB23 | 9100   | 90900   | 0            |

    Scenario: A party in cross maring mode has a partially filled pegged order, when the party switches to isolated margin mode the pegged order is cancelled (0019-MCAL-078)
        # iceberg pegged
        Given the parties submit update margin mode:
            | party      | market    | margin_mode  | margin_factor | error |
            | test_party | ETH/FEB23 | cross margin |               |       |
        When the parties place the following pegged iceberg orders:
            | party      | market id | peak size | minimum visible size | side | reference    | pegged reference | volume | offset |
            | test_party | ETH/FEB23 | 20        | 10                   | sell | sell_ice_peg | ASK              | 20     | -5     |
        And the parties place the following orders:
            | party    | market id | side | volume | price | resulting trades | type       | tif     | reference   |
            | aux_buys | ETH/FEB23 | buy  | 10     | 1000  | 1                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | auc-trade-1 |

        Then the parties should have the following margin levels:
            | party      | market id | maintenance | search | initial | release | margin mode  | margin factor | order |
            | test_party | ETH/FEB23 | 2000        | 2200   | 2400    | 2800    | cross margin |               | 0     |

        Given the parties should have the following account balances:
            | party      | asset | market id | margin | general |
            | test_party | USD   | ETH/FEB23 | 2400   | 97600   |
        When the parties submit update margin mode:
            | party      | market    | margin_mode     | margin_factor | error |
            | test_party | ETH/FEB23 | isolated margin | 0.91          |       |
        Then the orders should have the following status:
            | party      | reference    | status           |
            | test_party | sell_ice_peg | STATUS_CANCELLED |
        And the parties should have the following margin levels:
            | party      | market id | maintenance | search | initial | release | margin mode     | margin factor | order |
            | test_party | ETH/FEB23 | 1050        | 0      | 1260    | 0       | isolated margin | 0.91          | 0     |
        And the parties should have the following account balances:
            | party      | asset | market id | margin | general | order margin |
            | test_party | USD   | ETH/FEB23 | 9100   | 90900   | 0            |
