Feature: When the network party holds a non-zero position and there are not enough funds in market's insurance pool
         to meet the mark-to-market payment the network's position is unaffected and loss socialisation is applied. (0012-POSR-010)

  Background:
    Given the liquidation strategies:
      | name           | disposal step | disposal fraction | full disposal size | max fraction consumed |
      | disposal-strat | 1000          | 1.0               | 1000               | 1.0                   |

    Given the markets:
      | id        | quote name | asset | risk model                  | margin calculator                  | auction duration | fees         | price monitoring | data source config     | linear slippage factor | quadratic slippage factor | sla params      | liquidation strategy |

    And the following network parameters are set:
      | name                                    | value |
      | market.auction.minimumDuration          | 1     |

    # insurance pool generation - setup orderbook
    When the parties place the following orders:

    Then the opening auction period ends for market "ETH/DEC19"
    When the network moves ahead "1" blocks
    And the trading mode should be "TRADING_MODE_CONTINUOUS" for the market "ETH/DEC19"

    And the mark price should be "149" for the market "ETH/DEC19"

    Then the parties should have the following account balances:
      | party           | asset | market id | general |
      | designatedLoser | BTC   | ETH/DEC19 | 120     |

    Then the trading mode should be "TRADING_MODE_CONTINUOUS" for the market "ETH/DEC19"

    And the mark price should be "150" for the market "ETH/DEC19"

    # The designatedLoser will be closed out and have all their funds moved to the insurance pool
    Then the parties should have the following account balances:

    And the insurance pool balance should be "120" for the market "ETH/DEC19"    

    # check the network trades happened and the network party holds the volume
    Then the following network trades should be executed:
      | party           | aggressor side | volume |
      | designatedLoser | buy            | 250    |

    And the parties should have the following profit and loss:

    # Move the mark price to make our network trader lose money
    When the parties place the following orders:

    When the network moves ahead "1" blocks

    And the mark price should be "145" for the market "ETH/DEC19"

    # The insurance pool will be depleted due to the price move
    And the insurance pool balance should be "0" for the market "ETH/DEC19"    

    # Check that funds have not been fully paid (lose socialisation has taken place)
    # aux is short and should gain 6 but only gets 1 (will lose 5),
    # sellSideProvider is short and should gain 1250 but only gets 124 (will lose 1126)
    # Total distributed is 125 when it should have been 1255
    Then the parties should have the following account balances:

    # This part explicitly covers 0012-POSR-011:
    # The insurance pool balance is zero, so the network does not meet the required margin balance
    # Despite this, it can maintain its position, and loss socialisation kicks in during the MTM settlement.
    And the parties should have the following profit and loss:
