      | aux2             | BTC   | 100000000 |
# setup orderbook
    When the parties place the following orders:
      | party            | market id | side | volume | price | resulting trades | type       | tif     | reference       |
      | sellSideProvider | ETH/DEC19 | sell | 1000   | 120   | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | sell-provider-1 |
      | buySideProvider  | ETH/DEC19 | buy  | 1000   | 80    | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | buy-provider-1  |

      | aux2             | ETH/DEC19 | buy  | 1      | 80    | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | aux-b-1         |
      | aux1             | ETH/DEC19 | sell | 1      | 100   | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | aux-s-2         |
      | aux2             | ETH/DEC19 | buy  | 1      | 100   | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | aux-b-2         |
    Then the opening auction period ends for market "ETH/DEC19"
    And the mark price should be "100" for the market "ETH/DEC19"
    And the trading mode should be "TRADING_MODE_CONTINUOUS" for the market "ETH/DEC19"
# trade 1 occurs
    When the parties place the following orders with ticks:
      | party  | market id | side | volume | price | resulting trades | type       | tif     | reference |
      | party1 | ETH/DEC19 | sell | 25     | 100   | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | ref-1     |
      | party2 | ETH/DEC19 | buy  | 25     | 100   | 1                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | ref-2     |
# trade 2 occurs
    When the parties place the following orders with ticks:
      | party  | market id | side | volume | price | resulting trades | type       | tif     | reference |

# order book volume change
    Then the parties cancel the following orders:
      | party            | reference       |
      | sellSideProvider | sell-provider-1 |
      | buySideProvider  | buy-provider-1  |
    When the parties place the following orders with ticks:
      | party            | market id | side | volume | price | resulting trades | type       | tif     | reference       |
      | sellSideProvider | ETH/DEC19 | sell | 1000   | 300   | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | sell-provider-2 |
      | buySideProvider  | ETH/DEC19 | buy  | 1000   | 80    | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | buy-provider-2  |
    Then the parties cancel the following orders:
      | party | reference |
      | aux1  | aux-s-1   |
      | aux2  | aux-b-1   |
    And the trading mode should be "TRADING_MODE_CONTINUOUS" for the market "ETH/DEC19"

# trade 4 occurs
    When the parties place the following orders with ticks:
      | party  | market id | side | volume | price | resulting trades | type       | tif     | reference |
      | party2 | ETH/DEC19 | buy  | 10     | 180   | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | ref-1     |
      | party4 | ETH/DEC19 | sell | 10     | 180   | 1                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | ref-2     |

# check positions
    Then the parties should have the following profit and loss:
      | party  | volume | unrealised pnl | realised pnl |
      | party1 | 0      | 0              | -2500        |
      | party2 | 35     | 2000           | -1362        |
      | party3 | 75     | 6000           | -4083        |
      | party4 | -10    | 0              | 0            |
      
    And the insurance pool balance should be "0" for the market "ETH/DEC19"
