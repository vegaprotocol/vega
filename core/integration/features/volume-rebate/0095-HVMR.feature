Feature: Volume rebate program - contributions from trades

  Volume rebate program rewards parties who comprise above a specified
  fraction of the maker volume on the network in a window with an
  extra rebate factor.

  Tests check trades contribute towards a party's maker volume fraction
  correctly and that volume across windows and markets is correctly 
  counted and scaled where necessary.

  Background:
    
    # Initialise the network and register the assets
    Given the average block duration is "1"
    And the following network parameters are set:
      | name                                    | value |
