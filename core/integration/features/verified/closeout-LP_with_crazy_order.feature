  Scenario: Replicate a scenario from Lewis
    # 1. trader B made LP commitment 150,000
    # 2. trader C and A cross at 0.5 with size of 111, and this opens continuous trading (trade B is short)
    # 3. trader C comes with an order with crazy price
    # 4. trader Bâ€™s margin has increased sharply because of the order (from step2),
    # 5. trader A and C and trigger MTM
    # 6. trader B got closeout out, and the closeout trade was between trader B - network - trader C
