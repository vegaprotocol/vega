Feature: Price monitoring test using simple risk model

  Background:
    Given time is updated to "2020-10-16T00:00:00Z"
    And the price monitoring updated every "60" seconds named "my-price-monitoring":
      | horizon | probability | auction extension |
      | 60      | 0.95        | 240               |
      | 120     | 0.99        | 360               |
    And the simple risk model named "my-simple-risk-model":
      | long | short | max move up | min move down | probability of trading |
      | 0.11 | 0.1   | 10          | 11            | 0.1                    |
    And the markets:
      | id        | quote name | asset | auction duration | maturity date        | risk model           | margin calculator         | fees         | price monitoring    | oracle config          |
      | ETH/DEC20 | ETH        | ETH   | 240              | 2020-12-31T23:59:59Z | my-simple-risk-model | default-margin-calculator | default-none | my-price-monitoring | default-eth-for-future |
    And the following network parameters are set:
      | name                           | value |
      | market.auction.minimumDuration | 240   |

  Scenario: Persistent order results in an auction (both triggers breached), no orders placed during auction, auction terminates with a trade from order that originally triggered the auction.
    Given the traders deposit on asset's general account the following amount:
      | trader  | asset | amount       |
      | trader1 | ETH   | 10000        |

    Then the opening auction period ends for market "ETH/DEC20"
    And the trading mode should be "TRADING_MODE_CONTINUOUS" for the market "ETH/DEC20"
