Feature: Cannot place an network order

  Background:
    Given the insurance pool initial balance for the markets is "0":
    And the execution engine have these markets:
      | name      | base name | quote name | asset | mark price | risk model | lamd/long | tau/short | mu/max move up | r/min move down | sigma | release factor | initial factor | search factor | settlement price | auction duration | trading mode | maker fee | infrastructure fee | liquidity fee | p. m. update freq. | p. m. horizons | p. m. probs | p. m. durations | prob. of trading |
      | ETH/DEC19 | BTC       | ETH        | ETH   | 1000       | simple     | 0.11      | 0.1       | 0  | 0 | 0     | 1.4            | 1.2            | 1.1           | 42               | 0                | continuous   | 0         | 0                  | 0             | 0                  |                |             |                 | 0.1              |

  Scenario: an order is rejected if a trader try to place an order with type NETWORK
    Given the following traders:
      | name    | amount |
      | trader1 |      1 |
    Then I Expect the traders to have new general account:
      | name    | asset |
      | trader1 | ETH   |
    And "trader1" general accounts balance is "1"
    Then traders place following failing orders:
      | trader  | id        | type | volume | price | error              | type    |
      | trader1 | ETH/DEC19 | sell |      1 |  1000 | invalid order type | TYPE_NETWORK |
