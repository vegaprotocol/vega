Feature: test for issue 1920

  Background:
    Given the insurance pool initial balance for the markets is "0":
    And the execution engine have these markets:
      | name      | baseName | quoteName | asset | markprice | risk model | lamd/long | tau/short | mu | r | sigma | release factor | initial factor | search factor | settlementPrice | openAuction | trading mode | makerFee | infrastructureFee | liquidityFee | p. m. update freq. | p. m. horizons | p. m. probs | p. m. durations | Prob of trading | oracleSpecPubKeys     | oracleSpecProperty | oracleSpecPropertyType | oracleSpecBinding |
      | ETH/DEC19 | BTC      | ETH       | ETH   | 1000      | simple     | 0.11      | 0.1       | 0  | 0 | 0     | 1.4            | 1.2            | 1.1           | 42              | 0           | continuous   | 0        | 0                 | 0            | 0                  |                |             |                 | 0.1             | 0xDEADBEEF,0xCAFEDOOD | prices.ETH.value   | TYPE_INTEGER           | prices.ETH.value  |
    And oracles broadcast data signed with "0xDEADBEEF":
      | name             | value |
      | prices.ETH.value | 42   |

  Scenario: a trader place a new order in the system, margin are calculated, then the order is stopped, the margin is released
    Given the following traders:
      | name    | amount |
      | trader1 | 10000  |
    Then I Expect the traders to have new general account:
      | name    | asset |
      | trader1 | ETH   |
    And "trader1" general accounts balance is "10000"
    Then traders place following orders:
      | trader  | id        | type | volume | price | resulting trades | type  | tif |
      | trader1 | ETH/DEC19 | sell |      1 |  1000 |                0 | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_FOK |
    Then the margins levels for the traders are:
      | trader  | id        | maintenance | search | initial | release |
      | trader1 | ETH/DEC19 |         100 |    110 |     120 |     140 |
    Then I expect the trader to have a margin:
      | trader  | asset | id        | margin | general |
      | trader1 | ETH   | ETH/DEC19 |      0 |   10000 |
