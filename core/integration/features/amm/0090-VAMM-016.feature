    # Setting up the accounts and vAMM submission now is part of the background, because we'll be running scenarios 0090-VAMM-006 through 0090-VAMM-014 on this setup
    Given the parties deposit on asset's general account the following amount:
      | party  | asset | amount  |
      | lp1    | USD   | 1000000 |
      | lp2    | USD   | 1000000 |

      | party3 | USD   | 1000000 |
      | party4 | USD   | 1000000 |
      | party5 | USD   | 1000000 |
      | vamm1  | USD   | 1000000 |

    When the parties submit the following liquidity provision:
      | id   | party | market id | commitment amount | fee   | lp type    |
      | lp_1 | lp1   | ETH/MAR22 | 10000             | 0.02  | submission |

    And the parties place the following orders:
      | party  | market id | side | volume | price | resulting trades | type       | tif     | reference |
      | lp1    | ETH/MAR22 | buy  | 20     | 40    | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | lp1-b     |

    When the opening auction period ends for market "ETH/MAR22"
    Then the following trades should be executed:
      | buyer  | price | size | seller |
      | party1 | 100   | 1    | party2 |
      
    Then the network moves ahead "1" epochs
    And the current epoch is "1"

  @VAMM
  Scenario: 0090-VAMM-016: A vAMM's virtual ELS should be equal to the ELS of a regular LP with the same committed volume on the book (i.e. if a vAMM has an average volume on each side of the book across the epoch of 10k USDT, their ELS should be equal to that of a regular LP who has a commitment which requires supplying 10k USDT who joined at the same time as them).

    And the market data for the market "ETH/MAR22" should be:
      | mark price | trading mode            | target stake | supplied stake | open interest | ref price | mid price | static mid price |
      | 100        | TRADING_MODE_CONTINUOUS | 39           | 10000           | 0             | 100       | 100       | 100              |

    When the parties submit the following liquidity provision:
      # Using 10,093 instead of exactly 10,000 makes things easier because getting exactly 10,000 from an AMM pool as virtual stake can be tricky due to complex math.
      | id   | party | market id | commitment amount | fee   | lp type    |
      | lp_2 | lp2   | ETH/MAR22 | 10093             | 0.03  | submission |

    When the parties submit the following AMM:

    Then the AMM pool status should be:
      | party | market id | amount | status        | base | lower bound | upper bound | lower margin ratio | upper margin ratio |
      | vamm1 | ETH/MAR22 | 10000  | STATUS_ACTIVE | 100  | 95          | 105         | 0.96               | 0.96               |
    
    And set the following AMM sub account aliases:
      | party | market id | alias    |
      | vamm1 | ETH/MAR22 | vamm1-id |
    And the following transfers should happen:
      | from  | from account         | to       | to account           | market id | amount | asset | is amm | type                             |

    Then the network moves ahead "1" epochs
    And the current epoch is "2"
    And the liquidity provider fee shares for the market "ETH/MAR22" should be:
      | party                                                            | equity like share  | virtual stake          | average entry valuation |
