            | 5       | 0.99        | 6                 |

        And the liquidity monitoring parameters:
            | name       | triggering ratio | time window | scaling factor |
            | lqm-params | 0.00             | 24h         | 1e-9           |
        And the simple risk model named "simple-risk-model":

            | market.auction.minimumDuration | 1     |
        Given the average block duration is "1"

    Scenario: When the party has pegged orders and switches from cross margin mode to isolated margin mode, all the pegged orders will be stopped. (0019-MCAL-050,0019-MCAL-090)
        Given the parties deposit on asset's general account the following amount:
            | party            | asset | amount       |
            | buySideProvider  | USD   | 100000000000 |

            | party1           | USD   | 158550       |

        When the parties submit the following liquidity provision:
            | id  | party  | market id | commitment amount | fee | lp type    |
            | lp1 | party1 | ETH/FEB23 | 1000              | 0.1 | submission |

        And the parties place the following orders:
            | party            | market id | side | volume | price  | resulting trades | type       | tif     | reference |

        When the network moves ahead "2" blocks
        And the market data for the market "ETH/FEB23" should be:

        #now we try to place short pegged order which does offset the current short position, order margin should be 0
        When the parties place the following pegged orders:
            | party  | market id | side | volume | pegged reference | offset | reference |
