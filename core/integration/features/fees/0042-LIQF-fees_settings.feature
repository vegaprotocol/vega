      | long | short | max move up | min move down | probability of trading |
      | 0.1  | 0.1   | 500         | 500           | 0.1                    |
    And the fees configuration named "fees-config-1":
      | maker fee | infrastructure fee | liquidity fee method | liquidity fee constant |
      | 0.0004    | 0.001              | METHOD_CONSTANT      | 0.08                   |
    And the fees configuration named "fees-config-2":

  Scenario: 001 Liquidity fee setting to METHOD_CONSTANT(0042-LIQF-058), METHOD_MARGINAL_COST, and METHOD_WEIGHTED_AVERAGE(0042-LIQF-057)
    # setup accounts
    Given the parties deposit on asset's general account the following amount:
      | party  | asset | amount     |
      | lp1    | USD   | 1000000000 |
      | lp2    | USD   | 1000000000 |
      | party1 | USD   | 100000000  |
      | party2 | USD   | 100000000  |

    And the parties submit the following liquidity provision:
      | id  | party | market id | commitment amount | fee   | lp type    |
      | lp1 | lp1   | ETH/MAR22 | 800               | 0.005 | submission |
      | lp2 | lp2   | ETH/MAR22 | 300               | 0.004 | submission |

    And the parties place the following pegged iceberg orders:
      | party | market id | peak size | minimum visible size | side | pegged reference | volume | offset |
      | lp1   | ETH/MAR22 | 12        | 1                    | buy  | BID              | 12     | 2      |

      | lp1   | ETH/MAR22 | 12        | 1                    | sell | MID              | 12     | 1      |

    When the parties place the following orders:
      | party  | market id | side | volume | price | resulting trades | type       | tif     |
      | party1 | ETH/MAR22 | buy  | 1      | 900   | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |

      | party2 | ETH/MAR22 | sell | 10     | 1000  | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |

    Then the opening auction period ends for market "ETH/MAR22"

    And the following trades should be executed:
      | buyer  | price | size | seller |
      | party1 | 1000  | 10   | party2 |

    And the market data for the market "ETH/MAR22" should be:

    And the liquidity fee factor should be "0.08" for the market "ETH/MAR22"

    When the markets are updated:
      | id        | liquidity monitoring | linear slippage factor | quadratic slippage factor | liquidity fee settings |
      | ETH/MAR22 | lqm-params           | 1e-3                   | 0                         | fees-config-2          |
    Then the network moves ahead "1" blocks
    And the liquidity fee factor should be "0.01" for the market "ETH/MAR22"

    When the markets are updated:
      | id        | liquidity monitoring | linear slippage factor | quadratic slippage factor | liquidity fee settings |
      | ETH/MAR22 | lqm-params           | 1e-3                   | 0                         | fees-config-3          |
    Then the network moves ahead "1" blocks
    And the liquidity fee factor should be "0.0047272727272727" for the market "ETH/MAR22"

    When the parties submit the following liquidity provision:
      | id  | party | market id | commitment amount | fee   | lp type   |
      | lp1 | lp1   | ETH/MAR22 | 800               | 0.006 | amendment |
    Then the network moves ahead "1" blocks
    And the liquidity fee factor should be "0.0054545454545455" for the market "ETH/MAR22"

    When the markets are updated:
      | id        | liquidity monitoring | linear slippage factor | quadratic slippage factor | liquidity fee settings |
      | ETH/MAR22 | lqm-params           | 1e-3                   | 0                         | fees-config-4          |
    Then the network moves ahead "1" blocks
    And the liquidity fee factor should be "0.006" for the market "ETH/MAR22"
