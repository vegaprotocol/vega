Feature: Position resolution case 5 lognormal risk model

  Background:

    Given the log normal risk model named "lognormal-risk-model-fish":
      | risk aversion | tau  | mu | r   | sigma |
      | 0.001         | 0.01 | 0  | 0.0 | 1.2   |
    #calculated risk factor long: 0.336895684; risk factor short: 0.4878731

    And the price monitoring named "price-monitoring-1":
      | horizon | probability | auction extension |
      | 1       | 0.99999999  | 300               |

    And the margin calculator named "margin-calculator-1":
      | search factor | initial factor | release factor |
      | 1.2           | 1.5            | 2              |

    And the oracle spec for settlement data filtering data from "0xCAFECAFE" named "ethDec20Oracle":
      | property         | type         | binding         |
      | prices.ETH.value | TYPE_INTEGER | settlement data |

    And the oracle spec for trading termination filtering data from "0xCAFECAFE" named "ethDec20Oracle":
      | property           | type         | binding             |
      | trading.terminated | TYPE_BOOLEAN | trading termination |

    And the markets:
      | id        | quote name | asset | risk model                | margin calculator   | auction duration | fees         | price monitoring | data source config | linear slippage factor | quadratic slippage factor | sla params      |

  Scenario: 001 using lognormal risk model, setup a scenario where designatedLoser gets closed out; 0012-POSR-002, 0012-POSR-005, 0013-ACCT-001, 0013-ACCT-022

    # setup accounts
    Given the parties deposit on asset's general account the following amount:

      | lp1 | lpprov | ETH/DEC19 | 9000              | 0.1 | amendment  |
    And the parties place the following pegged iceberg orders:

    Then the opening auction period ends for market "ETH/DEC19"
    And the mark price should be "150" for the market "ETH/DEC19"
    And the trading mode should be "TRADING_MODE_CONTINUOUS" for the market "ETH/DEC19"

    #target_stake = mark_price x max_oi x target_stake_scaling_factor x rf=150*10*1*0.4878731=731

    Then the order book should have the following volumes for market "ETH/DEC19":
