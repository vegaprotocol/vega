			The XDG Base Directory specification defines where these files should be looked
			for by defining several base directories relative to which files should be 
			located. The location of these directories is specific to each platform.
			
			Role   | Linux          | MacOS                         | Windows

			state  | ~/.local/state | ~/Library/Application Support | %LOCALAPPDATA% 
			
			Vega applications also support setting a custom location for these files using
			the --home flag. Contrary to the XDG Base Directory specification, this flag
			will group the cache, config, data and state folders under a "vega" folder, at
			the specified location.`
