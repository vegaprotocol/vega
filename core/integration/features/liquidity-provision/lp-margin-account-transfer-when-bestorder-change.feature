  Background:
    Given the log normal risk model named "lognormal-risk-model-fish":
      | risk aversion | tau  | mu | r   | sigma |
      | 0.001         | 0.01 | 0  | 0.0 | 2     |
    #rf_short=0.9247862
    #rf_long=0.499476497
    And the price monitoring named "price-monitoring-1":
      | horizon | probability       | auction extension |
      | 36000   | 0.999999999999999 | 300               |
    And the margin calculator named "margin-calculator-1":
      | search factor | initial factor | release factor |
      | 1.2           | 1.5            | 2              |

    And the markets:
      | id        | quote name | asset | risk model                | margin calculator   | auction duration | fees         | price monitoring   | data source config     | linear slippage factor | quadratic slippage factor | sla params      |
      | ETH/DEC19 | ETH        | USD   | lognormal-risk-model-fish | margin-calculator-1 | 1                | default-none | price-monitoring-1 | default-eth-for-future | 1e6                    | 1e6                       | default-futures |

    And the following network parameters are set:
      | name                                                   | value |
      | market.liquidity.minimum.probabilityOfTrading.lpOrders | 0.01  |
      | network.markPriceUpdateMaximumFrequency                | 0s    |
      | limits.markets.maxPeggedOrders                         | 2     |
    And the average block duration is "1"

  Scenario: If best bid / ask has changed and the LP order volume is moved around to match the new peg levels then the margin requirement for the party may change. There is at most one transfer in / out of the margin account of the LP party as a result of one of the pegs moving. 0038-OLIQ-008

    Given the parties deposit on asset's general account the following amount:
      | party | asset | amount        |
      | aux   | USD   | 1000000000000 |
      | aux2  | USD   | 1000000000000 |
      | aux3  | USD   | 1000000000000 |
      | aux4  | USD   | 1000000000000 |
      | lp    | USD   | 1000000000000 |

    When the parties submit the following liquidity provision:
      | id  | party | market id | commitment amount | fee | lp type    |
      | lp1 | lp    | ETH/DEC19 | 90000             | 0   | submission |
      | lp1 | lp    | ETH/DEC19 | 90000             | 0   | submission |
    And the parties place the following pegged iceberg orders:
      | party  | market id | peak size | minimum visible size | side | pegged reference | volume     | offset | reference |
      | lp     | ETH/DEC19 | 693       | 693                  | buy  | BID              | 693        | 10     | ice-buy   |
