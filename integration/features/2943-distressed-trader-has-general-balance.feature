Feature: Distressed traders should not have general balance left

  Background:
    Given the markets starts on "2020-10-16T00:00:00Z" and expires on "2020-12-31T23:59:59Z"
    And the execution engine have these markets:
      | name      | quote name | asset | mark price | risk model | lamd/long | tau/short | mu/max move up | r/min move down | sigma | release factor | initial factor | search factor | settlement price | auction duration | maker fee | infrastructure fee | liquidity fee | p. m. update freq. | p. m. horizons | p. m. probs | p. m. durations | prob. of trading |
      | ETH/DEC20 | ETH        | ETH   | 1000       | simple     | 0.11      | 0.1       | 0              | 0               | 0     | 1.4            | 1.2            | 1.1           | 42               | 0                | 0         | 0                  | 0             | 0                  |                |             |                 | 0.1              |

    And the market trading mode for the market "ETH/DEC20" is "TRADING_MODE_CONTINUOUS"

  Scenario: Upper bound breached
    Given the following traders:
      | name    | amount         |
      | trader1 | 10000000000000 |
      | trader2 | 10000000000000 |
      | trader3 |          24000 |
      | trader4 | 10000000000000 |
      | trader5 | 10000000000000 |

    Then traders place following orders:
      | trader  | id        | type | volume | price | resulting trades | type       | tif     |
      | trader1 | ETH/DEC20 | sell |      1 | 100   |                0 | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |
      | trader2 | ETH/DEC20 | buy  |      1 | 100   |                1 | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |
      | trader1 | ETH/DEC20 | sell |     20 | 120   |                0 | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |
      | trader2 | ETH/DEC20 | buy  |     20 |  80   |                0 | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |


    And the mark price for the market "ETH/DEC20" is "100"

    And the market trading mode for the market "ETH/DEC20" is "TRADING_MODE_CONTINUOUS"

    # T0 + 1min - this causes the price for comparison of the bounds to be 567
    Then the time is updated to "2020-10-16T00:01:00Z"

    Then traders place following orders:
      | trader  | id        | type | volume | price | resulting trades | type       | tif     |
      | trader4 | ETH/DEC20 | sell |     10 | 100   |                0 | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |

    Then traders place following orders:
      | trader  | id        | type | volume | price | resulting trades | type       | tif     |
      | trader5 | ETH/DEC20 | buy  |     10 | 100   |                1 | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_FOK |
      | trader3 | ETH/DEC20 | buy  |     10 | 110   |                0 | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |
      | trader3 | ETH/DEC20 | sell |     10 | 120   |                0 | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |
    And dump orders

    Then I expect the trader to have a margin:
      | trader | asset | id        | margin | general       |
      | trader4| ETH   | ETH/DEC20 |    360 | 9999999999640 |
      | trader5| ETH   | ETH/DEC20 |    372 | 9999999999628 |

    And clear order events
    Then the trader submits LP:
      | id  | party   | market    | commitment amount  | fee | order side | order reference | order proportion | order offset |
      | lp1 | trader3 | ETH/DEC20 | 10000              | 0.1 | buy        | BID             | 10               | -10          |
      | lp1 | trader3 | ETH/DEC20 | 10000              | 0.1 | sell       | ASK             | 10               | 10           |
      # | lp1 | trader3 | ETH/DEC20 | 10000              | 0.1 | sell       | ASK             | 10               | 50           |
      # | lp1 | trader3 | ETH/DEC20 | 10000              | 0.1 | sell       | ASK             | 10               | 5            |
      # | lp1 | trader3 | ETH/DEC20 | 10000              | 0.1 | sell       | ASK             | 10               | 75           |
      # | lp1 | trader3 | ETH/DEC20 | 10000              | 0.1 | sell       | MID             | 10               | 75           |
    Then I see the LP events:
      | id  | party   | market    | commitment amount |
      | lp1 | trader3 | ETH/DEC20 | 10000             |
    And dump orders

    Then I see the following order events:
      | trader  | id        | side | volume | reference | offset | price | status        |
      | trader3 | ETH/DEC20 | buy  |    989 |      BID  | -10    | 100   | STATUS_ACTIVE |
      | trader3 | ETH/DEC20 | sell |    760 |      ASK  | 10     | 130   | STATUS_ACTIVE |
      # | trader3 | ETH/DEC20 | sell |    582 |      ASK  | 50     | 170   | STATUS_ACTIVE |
      # | trader3 | ETH/DEC20 | sell |    791 |      ASK  | 5      | 125   | STATUS_ACTIVE |
      # | trader3 | ETH/DEC20 | sell |    507 |      ASK  | 75     | 195   | STATUS_ACTIVE |
      # | trader3 | ETH/DEC20 | sell |    520 |      MID  | 75     | 190   | STATUS_ACTIVE |
    ## The sum of the margin + general account == 10000 - 10000 (commitment amount)
    And I expect the trader to have a margin:
      | trader | asset | id        | margin | general |
      | trader3| ETH   | ETH/DEC20 |  13186 |     814 |
      
    ## Now let's increase the mark price so trader3 gets distressed
    Then traders place following orders:
      | trader  | id        | type | volume | price | resulting trades | type       | tif     |
      | trader5 | ETH/DEC20 | buy  |     20 | 165   |                1 | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |
    And the mark price for the market "ETH/DEC20" is "120"

    Then I expect the trader to have a margin:
      | trader | asset | id        | margin | general |
      | trader3| ETH   | ETH/DEC20 |  13186 |     814 |
      # expected balances to be margin(15165) general(0), instead saw margin(13186), general(814), (trader: trader3)

    ## Now let's increase the mark price so trader3 gets distressed
    Then traders place following orders:
      | trader  | id        | type | volume | price | resulting trades | type       | tif     |
      | trader5 | ETH/DEC20 | buy  |     30 | 165   |                2 | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |
    And the mark price for the market "ETH/DEC20" is "130"

    Then I expect the trader to have a margin:
      | trader | asset | id        | margin | general |
      | trader3| ETH   | ETH/DEC20 |  17143 |       0 |
