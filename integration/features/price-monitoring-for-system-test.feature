Feature: Price monitoring test using forward risk model (bounds for the valid price moves around price of 100000 for the two horizons are: [99845,100156], [99711,100290])

  Background:
    Given the markets start on "2020-10-16T00:00:00Z" and expire on "2020-12-31T23:59:59Z"
    And the execution engine have these markets:
      | name      | quote name | asset | risk model | lamd/long | tau/short              | mu/max move up | r/min move down | sigma | release factor | initial factor | search factor | auction duration | maker fee | infrastructure fee | liquidity fee | p. m. update freq. | p. m. horizons | p. m. probs | p. m. durations | prob. of trading | oracle spec pub. keys | oracle spec property | oracle spec property type | oracle spec binding |
      | ETH/DEC20 | ETH        | ETH   | forward    | 0.000001  | 0.00011407711613050422 | 0              | 0.016           | 2.0   | 1.4            | 1.2            | 1.1           | 5                | 0         | 0                  | 0             | 4                  | 5,10           | 0.95,0.99   | 6,8             | 0.1              | 0xDEADBEEF,0xCAFEDOOD | prices.ETH.value     | TYPE_INTEGER              | prices.ETH.value    |
    And oracles broadcast data signed with "0xDEADBEEF":
      | name             | value |
      | prices.ETH.value | 42    |
    And the trading mode for the market "ETH/DEC20" is "TRADING_MODE_OPENING_AUCTION"

  Scenario: Scenario for the system test with opening auction
    Given the traders make the following deposits on asset's general account:
