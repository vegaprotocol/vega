Feature: Test margins releases on position = 0

  Background:

    And the markets:
      | id        | quote name | asset | risk model                | margin calculator                  | auction duration | fees         | price monitoring | oracle config          |

  Scenario: No margin left for fok order as first order (0011-MARA-003)
    Given the parties deposit on asset's general account the following amount:
      | party    | asset | amount     |
      | partyGuy | BTC   | 1000000000 |
      | party1   | BTC   | 1000000    |

   # place auxiliary orders so we always have best bid and best offer as to not trigger the liquidity auction
    Then the parties place the following orders:

    Then the opening auction period ends for market "ETH/DEC19"
    And the mark price should be "94" for the market "ETH/DEC19"
