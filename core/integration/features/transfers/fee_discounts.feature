    # setup accounts
    Given the parties deposit on asset's general account the following amount:
      | party   | asset | amount    |
      | aux1    | ETH   | 100000000 |
      | aux2    | ETH   | 100000000 |

    Then the parties place the following orders:
      | party | market id | side | volume | price | resulting trades | type       | tif     |
      | aux1  | ETH/DEC21 | buy  | 1000   | 1000  | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |
      | aux2  | ETH/DEC21 | sell | 1000   | 1000  | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |
      | aux1  | ETH/DEC21 | buy  | 100    | 900   | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |
      | aux2  | ETH/DEC21 | sell | 100    | 1100  | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |
    And the parties submit the following liquidity provision:
      | id  | party  | market id | commitment amount | fee | lp type    |
      | lp1 | lpprov | ETH/DEC21 | 90000             | 0.1 | submission |
      | lp1 | lpprov | ETH/DEC21 | 90000             | 0.1 | submission |
    And the parties place the following pegged iceberg orders:
      | party  | market id | peak size | minimum visible size | side | pegged reference | volume | offset |
      | lpprov | ETH/DEC21 | 10000     | 1                    | buy  | BID              | 20000  | 100    |

    Then the opening auction period ends for market "ETH/DEC21"
    And the market data for the market "ETH/DEC21" should be:
      | mark price | trading mode            |
      | 1000       | TRADING_MODE_CONTINUOUS |
    When the parties place the following orders "1" blocks apart:

      | f0b40ebdc5b92cf2cf82ff5d0c3f94085d23d5ec2d37d0b929e177c6d4d37e4c | ETH/DEC21 | buy  | 300    | 1002  | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |
      | trader4 | ETH/DEC21 | sell | 400    | 1002  | 1                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |

    Then the following trades should be executed:
      | buyer   | price | size | seller  | aggressor side |
      | f0b40ebdc5b92cf2cf82ff5d0c3f94085d23d5ec2d37d0b929e177c6d4d37e4c | 1002  | 300  | trader4 | sell           |

    And the following transfers should happen:
      | from    | to      | from account            | to account                       | market id | amount | asset |

@fee-discount
Scenario: transfer where fee-discount has decayed to 0 results in no fee discount (0057-TRAN-016)

    And the parties have the following transfer fee discounts:

    And the accumulated infrastructure fees should be "7" for the asset "ETH"

    # now do a transfer and check we pay the full fees
    # They will transfers 10000, fee is 0.5 * 10000 = 5000, discount is 0
    # 9998686 - 10000 - 5000 = 9983686
    Given the parties submit the following one off transfers:
