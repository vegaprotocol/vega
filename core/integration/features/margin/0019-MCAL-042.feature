Feature: Test order margin during continuous
  Background:
    # Set liquidity parameters to allow "zero" target-stake which is needed to construct the order-book defined in the ACs
    Given the following network parameters are set:
      | name                                    | value |
      | network.markPriceUpdateMaximumFrequency | 0s    |
    And the liquidity monitoring parameters:
      | name       | triggering ratio | time window | scaling factor |
      | lqm-params | 0.00             | 24h         | 1e-9           |
    And the simple risk model named "simple-risk-model":
      | long | short | max move up | min move down | probability of trading |
      | 0.1  | 0.2   | 100         | -100          | 0.2                    |
    And the markets:
