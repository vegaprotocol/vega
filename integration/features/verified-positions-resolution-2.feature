# setup accounts
    Given the traders deposit on asset's general account the following amount:
      | trader           | asset | amount        |
      | sellSideProvider | BTC   | 1000000000000 |
      | buySideProvider  | BTC   | 1000000000000 |
      | designatedLooser | BTC   | 12000         |
      | aux              | BTC   | 1000000000000 |
      | aux2             | BTC   | 1000000000000 |

# place auxiliary orders so we always have best bid and best offer as to not trigger the liquidity auction
    Then the traders place the following orders:
      | trader | market id | side | volume | price | resulting trades | type       | tif     |
      | aux    | ETH/DEC19 | buy  | 1      | 1     | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |
      | aux    | ETH/DEC19 | sell | 1      | 151   | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |
      | aux    | ETH/DEC19 | buy  | 1      | 150   | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |
      | aux2   | ETH/DEC19 | sell | 1      | 150   | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |
    Then the opening auction period ends for market "ETH/DEC19"
    And the mark price should be "150" for the market "ETH/DEC19"
    And the trading mode should be "TRADING_MODE_CONTINUOUS" for the market "ETH/DEC19"

# insurance pool generation - setup orderbook
    When the traders place the following orders:
      | trader           | market id | side | volume | price | resulting trades | type       | tif     | reference       |
      | sellSideProvider | ETH/DEC19 | sell | 290    | 150   | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | sell-provider-1 |
      | buySideProvider  | ETH/DEC19 | buy  | 1      | 140   | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | buy-provider-1  |

      | designatedLooser | ETH/DEC19 | buy  | 290    | 150   | 1                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | ref-1     |

# insurance pool generation - modify order book
    Then the traders cancel the following orders:
      | trader          | reference      |
      | buySideProvider | buy-provider-1 |
    When the traders place the following orders:
      | trader          | market id | side | volume | price | resulting trades | type       | tif     | reference      |
      | buySideProvider | ETH/DEC19 | buy  | 1      | 40    | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | buy-provider-2 |

# check the trader accounts
    Then the traders should have the following account balances:
      | trader           | asset | market id | margin | general |
      | designatedLooser | BTC   | ETH/DEC19 | 12000  | 0       |

# insurance pool generation - set new mark price (and trigger closeout)
    When the traders place the following orders:
      | trader           | market id | side | volume | price | resulting trades | type       | tif     | reference |
      | sellSideProvider | ETH/DEC19 | sell | 1      | 120   | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | ref-1     |
      | buySideProvider  | ETH/DEC19 | buy  | 1      | 120   | 1                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | ref-2     |

# check positions
    Then the traders should have the following profit and loss:
      | trader           | volume | unrealised pnl | realised pnl |
      | designatedLooser | 290    | -8700          | 0            |

# checking margins
    Then the traders should have the following account balances:
      | trader           | asset | market id | margin | general |
      | designatedLooser | BTC   | ETH/DEC19 | 3300   | 0       |

# then we make sure the insurance pool collected the funds
    And the insurance pool balance should be "0" for the market "ETH/DEC19"

# now we check what's left in the orderbook
# we expect 1 order at price of 40 to be left there on the buy side
# we sell a first time 1 to consume the book
# then try to sell 1 again with low price -> result in no trades -> buy side empty
# We expect no orders on the sell side: try to buy 1 for high price -> no trades -> sell side empty
    When the traders place the following orders:
      | trader           | market id | side | volume | price | resulting trades | type       | tif     | reference |
