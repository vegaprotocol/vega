Feature: Closeout scenarios
  # This is a test case to demonstrate an order can be rejected when the trader (who places an initial order) does not have enouge collateral to cover the initial margin level

  Background:

    Given the log normal risk model named "log-normal-risk-model-1":
      | risk aversion | tau | mu | r | sigma |
      | 0.000001      | 0.1 | 0  | 0 | 1.0   |
    #risk factor short = 3.55690359157934000
    #risk factor long = 0.801225765
    And the margin calculator named "margin-calculator-1":
      | search factor | initial factor | release factor |
      | 1.5           | 2              | 3              |
    And the markets:
      | id        | quote name | asset | risk model              | margin calculator   | auction duration | fees         | price monitoring | data source config     | linear slippage factor | quadratic slippage factor | sla params      |

    And the following network parameters are set:
      | name                                    | value |
      | market.auction.minimumDuration          | 1     |
