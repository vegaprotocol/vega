    Given the initial insurance pool balance is "1000" for all the markets
    And the parties submit the following liquidity provision:
      | id  | party   | market id | commitment amount | fee | lp type    |
      | lp1 | lpprov1 | ETH/DEC19 | 9000              | 0.1 | submission |

    And the network moves ahead "2" blocks
    Then the mark price should be "150" for the market "ETH/DEC19"
    And the trading mode should be "TRADING_MODE_CONTINUOUS" for the market "ETH/DEC19"
    And the trading mode should be "TRADING_MODE_OPENING_AUCTION" for the market "ETH/DEC20"
    And the trading mode should be "TRADING_MODE_OPENING_AUCTION" for the market "ETH/DEC21"
    And the trading mode should be "TRADING_MODE_OPENING_AUCTION" for the market "ETH/DEC22"
    And the trading mode should be "TRADING_MODE_OPENING_AUCTION" for the market "ETH/DEC23"

    ## Now ETH/DEC20 leaves opening auction
    When the parties place the following orders:

    And the network moves ahead "11" blocks
    Then the mark price should be "150" for the market "ETH/DEC20"

    And the trading mode should be "TRADING_MODE_CONTINUOUS" for the market "ETH/DEC19"
    And the trading mode should be "TRADING_MODE_CONTINUOUS" for the market "ETH/DEC20"

    ## Insurance pool for closed market is distributed
    And the insurance pool balance should be "500" for the market "ETH/DEC19"
    And the insurance pool balance should be "1500" for the market "ETH/DEC20"
    And the insurance pool balance should be "0" for the market "ETH/DEC21"
    And the insurance pool balance should be "0" for the market "ETH/DEC22"
    And the insurance pool balance should be "0" for the market "ETH/DEC23"

    And the global insurance pool balance should be "3000" for the asset "USD"

    ## Cancel ETH/DEC19
    When the market states are updated through governance:
      | market id | state                              | settlement price |
      | ETH/DEC19 | MARKET_STATE_UPDATE_TYPE_TERMINATE | 150              |

    ## Insurance pool for closed market is distributed as two equal parts to the remaining successor
    ## and the global insurance pool
    And the insurance pool balance should be "0" for the market "ETH/DEC19"
    And the insurance pool balance should be "1500" for the market "ETH/DEC20"

    And the global insurance pool balance should be "3500" for the asset "USD"

    And the network moves ahead "1" blocks

    ## Terminate ETH/DEC20
    Then the oracles broadcast data signed with "0xCAFECAAA":
      | name               | value |
      | trading.terminated | true  |

    And the network moves ahead "1" blocks

    ## Settle ETH/DEC20
    When the oracles broadcast data signed with "0xCAFECAAA":
      | name             | value    |
      | prices.ETH.value | 14000000 |

    Then the market state should be "STATE_SETTLED" for the market "ETH/DEC20"
    And then the network moves ahead "1" blocks

    And the insurance pool balance should be "1500" for the market "ETH/DEC20"
    And the global insurance pool balance should be "3500" for the asset "USD"

    And the network moves ahead "10" blocks

    And the global insurance pool balance should be "5000" for the asset "USD"

    ## The insurance pools from the settled/cancelled markets are all drained
    Then the insurance pool balance should be "0" for the market "ETH/DEC19"
    And the insurance pool balance should be "0" for the market "ETH/DEC20"
    And the insurance pool balance should be "0" for the market "ETH/DEC21"
    And the insurance pool balance should be "0" for the market "ETH/DEC22"
    And the insurance pool balance should be "0" for the market "ETH/DEC23"
