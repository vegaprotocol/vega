  Background:
    Given the insurance pool initial balance for the markets is "0":
    And the execution engine have these markets:
      | name      | quote name | asset | risk model | tau/short | lamd/long | mu/max move up | r/min move down | sigma | release factor | initial factor | search factor | auction duration | maker fee | infrastructure fee | liquidity fee | p. m. update freq. | p. m. horizons | p. m. probs | p. m. durations | prob. of trading | oracle spec pub. keys | oracle spec property | oracle spec property type | oracle spec binding |
      | ETH/DEC19 | ETH        | ETH   | simple     | 0.1       | 0.2       | 0              | 0               | 0     | 5              | 4              | 3.2           | 0                | 0         | 0                  | 0             | 0                  |                |             |                 | 0.1              | 0xDEADBEEF,0xCAFEDOOD | prices.ETH.value     | TYPE_INTEGER              | prices.ETH.value    |
    And oracles broadcast data signed with "0xDEADBEEF":
      | name             | value   |
      | prices.ETH.value | 9400000 |
    And the traders make the following deposits on asset's general account:
      | trader     | asset | amount       |
      | trader1    | ETH   | 1000000000   |
      | sellSideMM | ETH   | 100000000000 |
      | buySideMM  | ETH   | 100000000000 |
      | aux        | ETH   | 1000000000   |
    # place auxiliary orders so we always have best bid and best offer as to not trigger the liquidity auction
    Then traders place following orders:
      | trader  | id        | type | volume | price    | resulting trades | type        | tif     | 
      | aux     | ETH/DEC19 | buy  | 1      |  6999999 | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT  | TIF_GTC | 
      | aux     | ETH/DEC19 | sell | 1      | 50000001 | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT  | TIF_GTC | 

   
    # setting mark price
    And traders place following orders:
      | trader     | market id | side | volume | price    | resulting trades | type       | tif     |
      | sellSideMM | ETH/DEC19 | sell | 1      | 10300000 | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |
      | buySideMM  | ETH/DEC19 | buy  | 1      | 10300000 | 1                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |


    # setting order book
    And traders place following orders with references:
      | trader     | market id | side | volume | price    | resulting trades | type       | tif     | reference |
      | sellSideMM | ETH/DEC19 | sell | 10     | 15000000 | 0      | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | sell1     |
      | sellSideMM | ETH/DEC19 | sell | 14     | 14000000 | 0      | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | sell2     |
      | sellSideMM | ETH/DEC19 | sell | 2      | 11200000 | 0      | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | sell3     |
      | buySideMM  | ETH/DEC19 | buy  | 1      | 10000000 | 0      | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | buy1      |
      | buySideMM  | ETH/DEC19 | buy  | 3      | 9600000  | 0      | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | buy2      |
      | buySideMM  | ETH/DEC19 | buy  | 9      | 9000000  | 0      | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | buy3      |
      | buySideMM  | ETH/DEC19 | buy  | 50     | 8700000  | 0      | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | buy4      |


  Scenario:
    # no margin account created for trader1, just general account
    And "trader1" has only one account per asset
    # placing test order
    Then traders place following orders:
      | trader  | market id | side | volume | price   | resulting trades | type       | tif     |
      | trader1 | ETH/DEC19 | sell | 13     | 9000000 | 3      | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |
    And "trader1" general account for asset "ETH" balance is "698400040"
    And executed trades:
      | buyer     | price    | size | seller  |
      | buySideMM | 10000000 | 1    | trader1 |
      | buySideMM | 9600000  | 3    | trader1 |
      | buySideMM | 9000000  | 9    | trader1 |
    Then the following transfers happened:
      | from   | to      | from account            | to account          | market id | amount  | asset |
      | market | trader1 | ACCOUNT_TYPE_SETTLEMENT | ACCOUNT_TYPE_MARGIN | ETH/DEC19 | 2800000 | ETH   |

    Then traders have the following account balances:
      | trader  | asset | market id | margin    | general   |
      | trader1 | ETH   | ETH/DEC19 | 284399960 | 698400040 |
    And the margins levels for the traders are:
      | trader  | market id | maintenance | search    | initial   | release   |
      | trader1 | ETH/DEC19 | 71099990    | 227519968 | 284399960 | 355499950 |
    And traders have the following profit and loss:
      | trader  | volume | unrealised pnl | realised pnl |
      | trader1 | -13    | 2800000        | 0            |

    # NEW ORDERS ADDED WITHOUT ANOTHER TRADE HAPPENING
    Then traders cancel the following orders:
      | trader     | reference |
      | buySideMM  | buy4      |
      | sellSideMM | sell2     |
      | sellSideMM | sell3     |
    And traders place following orders:
      | trader     | market id | side | volume | price    | resulting trades | type       | tif     |
      | buySideMM  | ETH/DEC19 | buy  | 45     | 7000000  | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |
      | buySideMM  | ETH/DEC19 | buy  | 50     | 7500000  | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |
      | sellSideMM | ETH/DEC19 | sell | 14     | 10000000 | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |
      | sellSideMM | ETH/DEC19 | sell | 2      | 8000000  | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |
    Then traders have the following account balances:
      | trader  | asset | market id | margin    | general   |
      | trader1 | ETH   | ETH/DEC19 | 284399960 | 698400040 |
    And the margins levels for the traders are:
      | trader  | market id | maintenance | search    | initial   | release   |
      | trader1 | ETH/DEC19 | 71099990    | 227519968 | 284399960 | 355499950 |
    And traders have the following profit and loss:
      | trader  | volume | unrealised pnl | realised pnl |
      | trader1 | -13    | 2800000        | 0            |

    # ANOTHER TRADE HAPPENING (BY A DIFFERENT PARTY)
    # updating mark price to 300
    Then traders place following orders:
      | trader     | market id | side | volume | price    | resulting trades | type       | tif     |
      | sellSideMM | ETH/DEC19 | sell | 50     | 30000000 | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |
      | buySideMM  | ETH/DEC19 | buy  | 27     | 30000000 | 4                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |

    # MTM
    And the following transfers happened:
      | from    | to      | from account         | to account              | market id | amount    | asset |
      | trader1 | market  | ACCOUNT_TYPE_MARGIN  | ACCOUNT_TYPE_SETTLEMENT | ETH/DEC19 | 273000000 | ETH   |
      | trader1 | trader1 | ACCOUNT_TYPE_GENERAL | ACCOUNT_TYPE_MARGIN     | ETH/DEC19 | 144600040 | ETH   |

    Then traders have the following account balances:
      | trader  | asset | market id | margin    | general   |
      | trader1 | ETH   | ETH/DEC19 | 156000000 | 553800000 |
    And the margins levels for the traders are:
      | trader  | market id | maintenance | search    | initial   | release   |
      | trader1 | ETH/DEC19 |  39000000   | 124800000 | 156000000 | 195000000 |
    And position API produce the following:
      | trader  | volume | unrealisedPNL | realisedPNL |
      | trader1 | -13    | -270200000    | 0           |

    # ENTER SEARCH LEVEL (& DEPLEAT GENERAL ACCOUNT)
    Then traders place following orders:
      | trader     | market id | side | volume | price    | resulting trades | type       | tif     |
      | sellSideMM | ETH/DEC19 | sell | 11     | 50000000 | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |
      | buySideMM  | ETH/DEC19 | buy  | 50     | 50000000 | 2                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |
    And the margins levels for the traders are:
      | trader  | market id | maintenance | search    | initial   | release   |
      | trader1 | ETH/DEC19 | 65000000    | 208000000 | 260000000 | 325000000 |
    And traders have the following profit and loss:
      | trader  | volume | unrealised pnl | realised pnl |
      | trader1 | -13    | -530200000     | 0            |

    # FORCED CLOSEOUT
    Then traders place following orders:
      | trader     | market id | side | volume | price    | resulting trades | type       | tif     |
      | sellSideMM | ETH/DEC19 | sell | 21     | 80000000 | 0      | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |
      | buySideMM  | ETH/DEC19 | buy  | 11     | 80000000 | 2      | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |
    And I expect the trader to have a margin:
      | trader  | asset | market id | margin | general |
      | trader1 | ETH   | ETH/DEC19 |      0 |       0 |
    And the margins levels for the traders are:
      | trader  | market id | maintenance | search | initial | release |
      | trader1 | ETH/DEC19 | 0           | 0      | 0       | 0       |
    And position API produce the following:
      | trader  | volume | unrealisedPNL | realisedPNL |
      | trader1 | 0      | 0             |  -980000000 |
