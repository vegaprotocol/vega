# If a liquidity provider has fraction_of_time_on_book >= market.liquidity.committmentMinTimeFraction,
# no penalty will be taken from their bond account (0044-LIME-013)

  Scenario: 001, LP gets no penalty for 3/5 blocks of LP provision (0044-LIME-013)
    When the opening auction period ends for market "ETH/DEC21"
    And the auction ends with a traded volume of "10" at a price of "1000"
    Then the market data for the market "ETH/DEC21" should be:
      | mark price | trading mode            | target stake | supplied stake | open interest | best static bid price | static mid price | best static offer price |
      | 1000       | TRADING_MODE_CONTINUOUS | 1000         | 1000           | 10            | 999                   | 1000             | 1001                    |

    And the parties should have the following account balances:
      | party  | asset | market id | margin  | general  | bond |
      | party1 | ETH   | ETH/DEC21 | 2402400 | 97596600 | 1000 |    

    # Move forward an epoch and make sure the accounts do not change as we have 5/5 blocks covered
    When the network moves ahead "7" blocks
    Then the liquidity provisions should have the following states:
      | id  | party  | market    | commitment amount | status           |
      | lp1 | party1 | ETH/DEC21 | 1000              | STATUS_ACTIVE    |
    And the parties should have the following account balances:
      | party  | asset | market id | margin  | general  | bond |
      | party1 | ETH   | ETH/DEC21 | 2402400 | 97596600 | 1000 |    
    And the insurance pool balance should be "0" for the market "ETH/DEC21"

    # Move forward 6 blocks and then cancel the commitment covering order
    When the network moves ahead "6" blocks
    # Cancel the order so we are no longer covering our commitment
    Then the parties cancel the following orders:
      | party   | reference      |
      | party1  | party1-order1  |
      | party1  | party1-order2  |

    # Move forward 1 block to end the epoch and make sure we still do not get punished as we covered 4/5 blocks (0.8 coverage > 0.5 required)
    When the network moves ahead "1" blocks
    And the parties should have the following account balances:
      | party  | asset | market id | margin | general  | bond |
      | party1 | ETH   | ETH/DEC21 | 0      | 99999000 | 1000 |    
    And the insurance pool balance should be "0" for the market "ETH/DEC21"

    # Now move forward 7 more blocks to complete another epoch and to show we do get punished
    When the network moves ahead "7" blocks
    Then the market data for the market "ETH/DEC21" should be:
      | mark price | trading mode            | target stake | supplied stake | open interest | best static bid price | static mid price | best static offer price |
      | 1000       | TRADING_MODE_CONTINUOUS | 1000         | 810            | 10            | 900                   | 1000             | 1100                    |
    And the parties should have the following account balances:

      | party1 | ETH   | ETH/DEC21 | 0      | 99999000 | 810  |    
    And the insurance pool balance should be "190" for the market "ETH/DEC21"
