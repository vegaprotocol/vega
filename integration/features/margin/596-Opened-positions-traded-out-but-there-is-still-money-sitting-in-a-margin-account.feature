Feature: Regression test for issue 596

  Background:

    And the markets:
      | id        | quote name | asset | auction duration | risk model                    | margin calculator         | fees         | price monitoring | oracle config          |
      | ETH/DEC19 | BTC        | BTC   | 1                | default-log-normal-risk-model | default-margin-calculator | default-none | default-none     | default-eth-for-future |

  Scenario: Traded out position but monies left in margin account
    Given the parties deposit on asset's general account the following amount:
      | party  | asset | amount  |
      | edd     | BTC   | 10000   |
      | barney  | BTC   | 10000   |
      | chris   | BTC   | 10000   |
      | party1 | BTC   | 1000000 |
      | party2 | BTC   | 1000000 |
      | aux     | BTC   | 1000    |

  # place auxiliary orders so we always have best bid and best offer as to not trigger the liquidity auction
    When the parties place the following orders:
      | party | market id | side | volume | price | resulting trades | type       | tif     |
      | aux    | ETH/DEC19 | buy  | 1      | 95    | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |
      | aux    | ETH/DEC19 | sell | 1      | 105   | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |

    # Trigger an auction to set the mark price
    Then the parties place the following orders:
      | party  | market id | side | volume | price | resulting trades | type       | tif     | reference |
      | party1 | ETH/DEC19 | buy  | 1      | 100   | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GFA | party1-2 |

    Then the opening auction period ends for market "ETH/DEC19"
    And the mark price should be "100" for the market "ETH/DEC19"

    When the parties place the following orders:
      | party | market id | side | volume | price | resulting trades | type       | tif     | reference |
      | edd    | ETH/DEC19 | sell | 20     | 101   | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC | ref-1     |

    Then the parties should have the following account balances:
      | party | asset | market id | margin | general |
      | edd    | BTC   | ETH/DEC19 | 848    | 9152    |
      | barney | BTC   | ETH/DEC19 | 594    | 9406    |

      | barney | BTC   | ETH/DEC19 | 594    | 9406    |
    And the cumulated balance for all accounts should be worth "2031000"

      | barney | BTC   | ETH/DEC19 | 630    | 9272    |
    And the cumulated balance for all accounts should be worth "2031000"
