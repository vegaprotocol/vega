Feature: Fees when amend trades


  Background:
    Given the fees configuration named "fees-config-1":
      | maker fee | infrastructure fee |
      | 0.005     | 0.002              |
    And the price monitoring named "price-monitoring":
      | horizon | probability | auction extension |
      | 1       | 0.99        | 3                 |
    And the simple risk model named "simple-risk-model-1":
      | long | short | max move up | min move down | probability of trading |
      | 0.2  | 0.1   | 100         | -100          | 0.1                    |

    And the markets:

    # setup accounts
    Given the parties deposit on asset's general account the following amount:
