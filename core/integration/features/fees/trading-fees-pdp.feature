    # setup accounts
    Given the parties deposit on asset's general account the following amount:

    Then the opening auction period ends for market "ETH/DEC21"
    And the market data for the market "ETH/DEC21" should be:
      | mark price | trading mode            |

      | trader3 | ETH   | ETH/DEC21 | 720    | 9280    |

    And the accumulated infrastructure fees should be "0" for the asset "ETH"
    And the accumulated liquidity fees should be "0" for the market "ETH/DEC21"

      | mark price | trading mode            |

    Then the following trades should be executed:

    # Trader4 margin + general account balance = 10000 - 16 ( Maker fees) - 7 (Infra fee) = 99977

    Then the parties should have the following account balances:

      | trader4 | ETH   | ETH/DEC21 | 718    | 8958    |

    And the accumulated infrastructure fees should be "7" for the asset "ETH"
    ## Because we move forwards in time to MTM, the fees have been paid already. We see the transfer of 301, but that is paid out
    And the accumulated liquidity fees should be "0" for the market "ETH/DEC21"
  #And the accumulated liquidity fees should be "301" for the market "ETH/DEC21"

# TO DO -
# Testing fees in continuous trading with two trades and one liquidity providers with 10 & 0s liquidity fee distribution timestep
# During continuous trading, if a trade is matched and the aggressor / price taker has insufficient balance in their general (but margin covers it) account, then the trade fees gets executed in this order - Maker, IP, LP
# During continuous trading, if a trade is matched and the aggressor / price taker has insufficient balance in their general (and margin) account, then the trade doesn't execute
# Fees are collected in one case of amends: you amend the price so far that it causes an immediate trade - Issue # 3777
# During all 3 Auction sessions, fees are spilt 1/2 for IF and LP. Maker = 0
# During auction trading, when insufficient balance in their general account but margin covers the fees
# During auction trading, when insufficient balance in their general (+ margin) account, then the trade still goes ahead, (fees gets executed in this order - Maker(0), IP, LP)
# Fees calculations during Position Resolution when the fees could be paid on pro rated basis.

# Fees calculations during Position Resolution when insufficient balance in their general and margin account, then the fees gets paid in order - Maker, IP and then LP else don't get paid
# <PC> - Even after reducing trader's balance Or increasing the fees factors, the fees are being taken fully and thereby reducing the realised PnL.
# Reducing account balances somehow lowers the margin requirement so the fees again gets covered by the deficient created.

# Liquidity provider orders results in a trade - pegged orders so that orders of LP gets matched and LP gets maker fee. (LP is a price maker and not taker here) with suffficent balance -
# <PC> - Somehow the trades for party aux1 with size = 20 at price = 990 are getting cancelled and new trades of size = 21 at price = 965 are getting placed so unable to crossed LP pegged orders

# Last 3 API points - <PC> - Updated the #3692 issue with API requirement
# Changing parameters (via governance votes) does change the fees being collected appropriately even if the market is already running - Done
