Feature: Set up a market, with an opening auction, then uncross the book


  Background:
    Given the insurance pool initial balance for the markets is "0":
    And the execution engine have these markets:
      | name      | base name | quote name | asset | mark price | risk model | lamd/long              | tau/short              | mu/max move up | r/min move down | sigma | release factor | initial factor | search factor | settlement price | auction duration | trading mode | maker fee | infrastructure fee | liquidity fee | p. m. update freq. | p. m. horizons | p. m. probs | p. m. durations | prob. of trading |
      | ETH/DEC20 | ETH      | ETH       | ETH   | 100       | simple     | 0.08628781058136630000 | 0.09370922348428490000 | -1 | -1 | -1    | 1.4            | 1.2            | 1.1           | 100             | 1           | continuous   |    0.004 |             0.001 |          0.3 |                 0  |                |             |                 | 0.1             |

  Scenario: set up 2 traders with balance
    # setup accounts
    Given the following traders:
      | name    | amount     |
      | trader1 | 1000000000 |
      | trader2 | 1000000000 |
      | trader3 | 1000000000 |
    Then I Expect the traders to have new general account:
      | name    | asset |
      | trader1 | ETH   |
      | trader2 | ETH   |
      | trader3 | ETH   |

    # place orders and generate trades - slippage 100
    Then traders place following orders with references:
      | trader  | id        | type | volume | price    | resulting trades | type        | tif     | reference |
      | trader1 | ETH/DEC20 | sell | 1      | 10500000 | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT  | TIF_GTC | t1-s-1    |
      | trader2 | ETH/DEC20 | buy  | 1      |  9500000 | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT  | TIF_GTC | t2-b-1    |
      | trader1 | ETH/DEC20 | buy  | 1      | 10000000 | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT  | TIF_GFA | t1-b-1    |
      | trader2 | ETH/DEC20 | sell | 1      | 10000000 | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT  | TIF_GFA | t2-s-1    |

    Then the opening auction period for market "ETH/DEC20" ends

    And executed trades:
      | buyer   | price    | size | seller  |
      | trader1 | 10000000 | 1    | trader2 |
    And the mark price for the market "ETH/DEC20" is "10000000"

    Then traders place following orders with references:
      | trader  | id        | type | volume | price    | resulting trades | type        | tif     | reference |
      | trader1 | ETH/DEC20 | buy  | 1      | 10000000 | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT  | TIF_GTC | post-oa-1 |
      | trader3 | ETH/DEC20 | sell | 1      | 10000000 | 1                | TYPE_LIMIT  | TIF_GTC | post-oa-2 |

    Then I expect the trader to have a margin:
      | trader  | asset | id        | margin  | general   |
      | trader3 | ETH   | ETH/DEC20 | 1724511 | 995225489 |
    And dump transfers
    And the following transfers happened:
      | from    | to      | fromType                | toType                           | id        | amount  | asset |

      | trader3 |         | ACCOUNT_TYPE_GENERAL    | ACCOUNT_TYPE_FEES_INFRASTRUCTURE |           |   10000 | ETH   |
      | trader3 | market  | ACCOUNT_TYPE_GENERAL    | ACCOUNT_TYPE_FEES_LIQUIDITY      | ETH/DEC20 | 3000000 | ETH   |
      | market  | trader1 | ACCOUNT_TYPE_FEES_MAKER | ACCOUNT_TYPE_GENERAL             | ETH/DEC20 |   40000 | ETH   |
    And clear transfer events

    # Amend orders to set slippage to 120
    Then traders amends the following orders reference:
      | trader  | reference   | price    | sizeDelta | expiresAt | tif     | success |
      | trader1 | t1-s-1      | 12500000 |        0  |         0 | TIF_GTC | true    |
