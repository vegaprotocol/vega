    # we change the max shape to 4, nothing existing is affected but new provisions won't be accepted with more than 4
    Given the following network parameters are set:

  Scenario: liquidity provision submission with all proportions set to 0 results in an error
    Given the parties deposit on asset's general account the following amount:
