# Feature Overview
A simple overview that describes what this feature (or sub feature) needs to do and why it's valuable. 
This should be brief, understandable by anyone in the business and use the format: 

As a (type of user/actor the feature serves - doesn't have to be a person, could be another system etc.) 
I want (the action that needs to be performed / made possible)
So that (the goal/result/value that is achievedthe actor or the business)

As a (who - the type of user/actor the feature serves) 
I want (what - the action to be performed / made possible)
So that (why - the goal/result/value it achieves to the user/actor or the business)

** API Calls 
A list of the API calls that are needed for this feature, written in an implementation-agnostic format:

- "Get a list of widgets, categorised by X", rather than "GET /widgets?category=X"

# Product Owner
The name of the person in the Product team that is responsible for this feature. This will be the go-to person for the engineer working on this ticket for any questions / clarifications, to get feedback on work in progress and who will ultimately accept the feature ticket as 'done'.

# Acceptance Criteria
A list of criteria (aim for 3!) that have to be met for this feature to be accepted as 'done' by the product team. Acceptance criteria should be simple, single sentence statements written from the perspective of the work already having been done. Each statement should be able to be objectively determined to be true or false. For example:

- It is possible to
- It is possible to
- Vega does
- Vega does

# Feature Test Scenarios
Links to scenarios (at least 1!) that can be executed as feature tests to verify that the feature has been implemented as expected. We use the follow format:

GIVEN (setup/context) 
WHEN (action) 
THEN (assertion) 

For example...

Feature: Account Holder withdraws cash

  Scenario: Account has sufficient funds
   GIVEN the account balance is $100
     AND the card is valid
     AND the machine contains enough money  
    WHEN the Account Holder requests $20
    THEN the ATM should dispense $20
     AND the account balance should be $80
     AND the card should be returned
     
See https://github.com/vegaprotocol/vega/tree/develop/integration/ for more format information and examples.

_TBC whether these should be separate files  - will come back to this_
