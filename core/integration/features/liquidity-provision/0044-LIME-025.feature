Feature: Check early exit liquidity penalty is working

# For a market with market.liquidity.earlyExitPenalty = 0.25 and total stake = target stake + 140 already,
# if one liquidity provider places a transaction to reduce their stake by 100 followed by a second liquidity
# provider who reduces their commitment by 100, the first liquidity provider will receive a full 100 stake back
# whilst the second will receive a total of 85 back into their general account with 15 transferred into the 
# market's insurance account (40 received without penalty, then the remaining 60 receiving a 25% penalty). (0044-LIME-025)
