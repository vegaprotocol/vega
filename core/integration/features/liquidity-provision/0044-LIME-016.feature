    Given the average block duration is "1"
  @Now
  Scenario: 001: lp1 and lp2 on the market ETH/MAR22, 0044-LIME-016
    Given the parties deposit on asset's general account the following amount:
      | party  | asset | amount |
      | lp1    | USD   | 100000 |
      | lp2    | USD   | 100000 |
      | party1 | USD   | 100000 |
      | party2 | USD   | 100000 |
      | party3 | USD   | 100000 |

    And the parties submit the following liquidity provision:
      | id   | party | market id | commitment amount | fee   | lp type    |
      | lp_1 | lp1   | ETH/MAR22 | 4000              | 0.02  | submission |
      | lp_2 | lp2   | ETH/MAR22 | 4000              | 0.015 | submission |

    When the network moves ahead "4" blocks
    And the parties place the following pegged iceberg orders:
      | party | market id | peak size | minimum visible size | side | pegged reference | volume | offset | reference |
      | lp1   | ETH/MAR22 | 12        | 1                    | buy  | BID              | 12     | 20     | lp-b-1    |
      | lp1   | ETH/MAR22 | 12        | 1                    | sell | ASK              | 12     | 20     | lp-s-1    |

    Then the parties place the following orders:
      | party  | market id | side | volume | price | resulting trades | type       | tif     |
      | party1 | ETH/MAR22 | buy  | 10     | 900   | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |
      | party1 | ETH/MAR22 | buy  | 1      | 1000  | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |
      | party2 | ETH/MAR22 | sell | 10     | 1100  | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |
      | party2 | ETH/MAR22 | sell | 1      | 1000  | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GTC |

    Then the opening auction period ends for market "ETH/MAR22"
    And the following trades should be executed:
      | buyer  | price | size | seller |
      | party1 | 1000  | 1    | party2 |

    And the market data for the market "ETH/MAR22" should be:
      | mark price | trading mode            | horizon | min bound | max bound | target stake | supplied stake | open interest |
      | 1000       | TRADING_MODE_CONTINUOUS | 3600    | 973       | 1027      | 3556         | 8000           | 1             |
    # target_stake = mark_price x max_oi x target_stake_scaling_factor x rf = 1000 x 1 x 1 x 3.5569036 =3556
    And the liquidity fee factor should be "0.015" for the market "ETH/MAR22"

    When the network moves ahead "3" blocks
    Then the parties cancel the following orders:
      | party | reference |
      | lp1   | lp-b-1    |
      | lp1   | lp-s-1    |
    When the network moves ahead "7" blocks
    #fraction_of_time_on_book=0.375
    #0.2 * (1 - 0.375 / 0.6) = 0.075, so bond penalty for lp1 should be 0.075*4000=300; bond penalty for lp2 should be 0.2*4000=2400
    Then the following transfers should happen:
      | from | to     | from account      | to account             | market id | amount | asset |
      | lp1  | market | ACCOUNT_TYPE_BOND | ACCOUNT_TYPE_INSURANCE | ETH/MAR22 | 300    | USD   |
      | lp2  | market | ACCOUNT_TYPE_BOND | ACCOUNT_TYPE_INSURANCE | ETH/MAR22 | 800    | USD   |
